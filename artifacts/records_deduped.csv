                  <jats:italic>Objective.</jats:italic> Brain-computer interface (BCI) aims to establish communication paths between the brain processes and external devices. Different methods have been used to extract human intentions from electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Those based on motor imagery (MI) seem to have a great potential for future applications. These approaches rely on the extraction of EEG distinctive patterns during imagined movements. Techniques able to extract patterns from raw signals represent an important target for BCI as they do not need labor-intensive data pre-processing. <jats:italic>Approach.</jats:italic> We propose a new approach based on a 10-layer one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to classify five brain states (four MI classes plus a ‘baseline’ class) using a data augmentation algorithm and a limited number of EEG channels. In addition, we present a transfer learning method used to extract critical features from the EEG group dataset and then to customize the model to the single individual by training its late layers with only 12-min individual-related data. <jats:italic>Main results.</jats:italic> The model tested with the ‘EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset’ outperforms the current state-of-the-art models by achieving a <jats:inline-formula>

In theory, and if the model has been trained accurately, it should be able to identify a class and label it accordingly. The CNN model will then be restored and used to try and identify the same class of motor imagery data using much smaller sampled data in an attempt to simulate live data. Approach PyCharm, a Python platform, will be used to house and process the CNN. The raw data used for the training of the CNN will be sourced from the PhysioBank website. The EEG signal data will then be pre-processed using Brainstorm software that is a toolbox used in conjunction with MATLAB. The sample data used to validate and test the trained CNN, will be also be extracted from Brainstorm but in a much smaller size compared to the training data which is comprised of thousands of images. The sample size would be comparable to a person wearing a Brain Computer Interface (BCI), offering approximately 20 seconds of motor imagery signal data. Results The raw EEG data was successfully extracted and pre-processed. The deep learning model was trained using the extracted image data along with their corresponding labels. After training, it was able to accurately identify the T1 class label at 100 percent. The python coding was then modified to restore the trained model and feed it test sample data in which it was found to recognise 6 out of 10 lines of T1 signal image data. The result suggested that the initial training of the model required a different, more varying approach, so that it would be able to detect varying sample signal image data. The outcome of which could mean that the model could be used in applications for multiple patients wearing the same BCI hardware to control a device or interface.</jats:p>",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202206.0053.v1,https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202206.0053.v1,English,Include,,Classification of EEG Motor Imagery Using Deep Learning for Brain-Computer Interface Systems,Exclude,No performance metrics reported,No metrics found in full text,,0.9,0.6,

Motor Imagery (MI) brain signals derived from Electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly utilized in various BCI fields. However, accurately classifying MI-based EEG signals remains a significant challenge, with traditional classification techniques struggling to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features, resulting in suboptimal performance. Therefore, this study introduces a novel hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework designed for EEG-MI task classification. The model combines adaptive learning with optimal training to significantly improve classification performance using the Berlin BCI Dataset 1 from BCI Competition IV. The proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.38% on subject independence evaluation. This research compares subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), as well as Deep Learning (DL) models, such as EEGNet, K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Extensive evaluations and cross-validation prove the model's superior performance, thus this work sets a benchmark for real-time MI-EEG classification, offering a scalable solution for practical BCI applications.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.48084/etasr.9945,English,Exclude,Outside date range,Development of a CNN-LSTM Deep Learning Model for Motor Imagery EEG Classification for BCI Applications,,,,,0.95,0.25,cv_reported

In modern-day information technology, understanding music emotions through human-computer interaction plays a vital role in capturing the attention of both researchers and the music industry. This paper presents a learning algorithm by adopting the decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and CNN-LSTM hybrid deep learning approaches with relevant feature extraction techniques. Many researchers have performed emotion recognition in music for different languages such as English, Chinese, Spanish, Turkish, Hindi, etc. However, languages like Assamese have drawn very little attention in the research of music emotion recognition (MER). This work aims to perform a novel approach to emotion recognition in Assamese songs. In this study, a newly created Assamese dataset of 200 song samples is used with four different emotions and another dataset used is the RAVDESS emotional song database which consists of 1012 song samples with six different music emotions. Relevant features such as mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC), mel spectrogram, and chroma features are extracted from the song samples to investigate the performance of the proposed method. A comparative analysis using different classifiers is carried out and the findings of this study suggest that the CNN-LSTM model has shown better accuracy with both datasets. The accuracy is 85.00% with the Assamese dataset, and with the RAVDESS dataset, the accuracy is 89.66% compared to the other classifiers used in this work.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.46281/bjmsr.v9i3.2230,English,Exclude,Not EEG-BCI focused,MUSIC EMOTION RECOGNITION AND CLASSIFICATION USING HYBRID CNN-LSTM DEEP NEURAL NETWORK,,,,,0.9,0.6,

However, the activity generated by the BCI makes measurements for objective fatigue evaluation very difficult, and the situation is further complicated due to different movement artefacts. The BCI performance could be increased if an online method existed to measure the fatigue objectively and accurately. While BCI-users are moving, a novel automatic online artefact removal technique is used to filter out these movement artefacts. The effects of this filter on BCI performance and mainly on peak frequency detection during BCI use were investigated in this paper. A successful peak alpha frequency measurement can lead to more accurately determining objective user fatigue. Fifteen subjects performed various imaginary and actual movements in separate tasks, while fourteen electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes were used. Afterwards, a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI speller was used, and the users were instructed to perform various movements. An offline curve fitting method was used for alpha peak detection to assess the effect of the artefact filtering. Peak detection was improved by the filter, by finding 10.91% and 9.68% more alpha peaks during simple EEG recordings and BCI use, respectively. As expected, BCI performance deteriorated from movements, and also from artefact removal. Average information transfer rates (ITRs) were 20.27 bit/min, 16.96 bit/min, and 14.14 bit/min for the (1) movement-free, (2) the moving and unfiltered, and (3) the moving and filtered scenarios, respectively.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci9120347,English,Exclude,Not classification-focused,Peak Detection with Online Electroencephalography (EEG) Artifact Removal for Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) Purposes,,,,,0.85,0.6,

        <jats:p>The early diagnosis of brain tumors is critical to enhancing patient survival and prospects. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain tumor images must be physically analyzed in this work. As a result, computerized approaches for more precise tumor diagnostics are required. However, evaluating shape, volume, borders, Tumor detection, size, segmentation, and classification remains challenging. This work proposes a hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) classifier using an enhanced LuNet classifier algorithm in this proposed work. The primary intention of this work is to determine the area of the tumor site and classify brain tumors as benign or malignant. Initially, we split the data using the extended LuNet algorithm. Grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and VGG16 extracted the features, yielding 13 classification features. For pretreatment, the Laplacian of Gaussian filter (LOG) is used. Overall, the proposed approach tries to increase the performance of non-deep learning classifiers. Traditional classifiers are superior deep learning methods because they require fewer training data sets, have lower computing complexity, lower user costs, and are easier to use by people with less training experience. The proposed algorithm achieves a better accuracy rate of 99.7%. Compared to the existing algorithm, the proposed approach outperforms them.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1599383/v1,English,Exclude,Not EEG-BCI focused,Brain Tumor Segmentation and Classification using hybrid Deep CNN with LuNet Classifier,,,,,0.9,0.6,

As one well-known non-invasive BCI technique, electroencephalography (EEG) records the brain’s electrical signals from the scalp surface area. However, due to the non-stationary nature of the EEG signal, the distribution of the data collected at different times or from different subjects may be different. These problems affect the performance of the BCI system and limit the scope of its practical application. In this study, an unsupervised deep-transfer-learning-based method was proposed to deal with the current limitations of BCI systems by applying the idea of transfer learning to the classification of motor imagery EEG signals. The Euclidean space data alignment (EA) approach was adopted to align the covariance matrix of source and target domain EEG data in Euclidean space. Then, the common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to extract features from the aligned data matrix, and the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied for EEG classification.

However, the challenges faced are inter-subject variability, BCI illiteracy and poor machine learning decoding performance. Two emerging intuitive mental paradigms, Visual Imagery (VI) and Imagined Speech (IS) show promise to optimise the development of non-invasive BCIs, which involves the extraction of corresponding neural patterns during the imagined tasks. This study took a comprehensive user-centric approach to build on the current foundation of knowledge on VI and IS EEG-BCIs utilising an adapted 1D-CNN to optimise the classification decoding performance. Twenty healthy participants were assessed for their ability to visualise imagery in their minds and performed the VI and IS mental paradigms in two class conditions “push” and “relax”. It was shown that alpha and beta suppression was observed during the “push” condition of VI compared to the “relax” condition, and those that scored higher in the VVIQ had better VI classification accuracy than those who did not. The adapted 1D-CNN model performed well for classification between the two classes “push” and “relax” at 89.3% and 77.87% performance accuracy for VI and IS, respectively. These findings contribute to the current body of work on VI BCI, that it is a dynamic and plausible option compared to standard BCI paradigms, and VI BCI illiteracy could potentially be controlled by VVIQ.

In fNIRS-BCI systems, deep learning (DL) algorithms play a crucial role in enhancing accuracy. Unlike traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers, DL algorithms eliminate the need for manual feature extraction. DL neural networks automatically extract hidden patterns/features within a dataset to classify the data. In this study, a hand-gripping (closing and opening) two-class motor activity dataset from twenty healthy participants is acquired, and an integrated contextual gate network (ICGN) algorithm (proposed) is applied to that dataset to enhance the classification accuracy. The proposed algorithm extracts the features from the filtered data and generates the patterns based on the information from the previous cells within the network. Accordingly, classification is performed based on the similar generated patterns within the dataset. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The proposed ICGN algorithm yielded a classification accuracy of 91.23 ± 1.60%, which is significantly (p &lt; 0.025) higher than the 84.89 ± 3.91 and 88.82 ± 1.96 achieved by LSTM and Bi-LSTM, respectively. An open access, three-class (right- and left-hand finger tapping and dominant foot tapping) dataset of 30 subjects is used to validate the proposed algorithm.

Early diagnosis plays a vital role in determining appropriate treatment. In addition to clinical routines, artificial intelligence‐based systems that produce automated, quantitative, and objective results can assist clinicians and scientists in making early diagnoses. For this motivation, this study proposes a deep learning‐based system that classifies brain tumors obtained by magnetic resonance imaging. In the proposed approach, several wavelet transform approaches are applied to the raw dataset images. Thus, in addition to automated feature extraction in deep learning, it aimed to detect more detailed features. Therefore, four types of datasets have been obtained. Then, using the transfer learning approach, some popular convolutional neural network and vision transformer models are trained separately with the four‐type datasets, and the test results are compared. The networks that produced the highest results are used to make the final decision with the ensemble technique. In the first analysis, the best performance was obtained using original data with an 83.50% accuracy value, and the second highest performance is obtained 81.72% accuracy value using the Daubhecies wavelet before deep learning. The third and fourth high performances are 81.47% and 81.22% accuracy, respectively, using original data. In the ensemble analysis, the highest result is achieved at 85.03% accuracy value using the bagging‐ensemble approach of the networks, namely MobileNet‐v3, vision transformer, ResNeXt, and DenseNet‐201. This study demonstrates that using a hybrid wavelet transform and deep learning approach improves classification performance.

Traditional paperwork methods are often inefficient and error-prone, leading to potential non-compliance. This research addresses these challenges by developing an AI-powered electronic document management system designed to automate compliance checks and simplify document handling as HEIs grow. The primary objective is to create a document classification model utilizing deep learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and a hybrid CNN-RNN approach, to enhance document accuracy and compliance. The study involves collecting and preprocessing a substantial dataset of documents, designing and evaluating various deep learning models, and optimizing hyperparameters. Performance comparisons among the models indicate that the hybrid CNN-RNN architecture outperforms individual models, achieving superior accuracy, recall, and F1-score, alongside a significantly lower mean squared error (MSE). Initial evaluations revealed the CNN, RNN, and CNN-RNN models achieved accuracies of 73%, 44%, and 27%, respectively, on the raw dataset. However, with an upgraded dataset, these models improved to 76%, 48%, and 79% accuracy, respectively, highlighting the hybrid model's enhanced capability in accurately classifying documents. The findings revealed the effectiveness of integrating advanced deep learning techniques to improve document verification processes in HEIs, ultimately facilitating better compliance and operational efficiency.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.62050/fscp2024.462,English,Exclude,Outside date range,Document Classification in HEIs Using Deep Learning,,,,,0.95,0.6,

        <p>Image classification is a key application of computer vision that finds direct relevance in medical diagnostics, autonomous vehicles, and remote sensing. This paper discusses the use of AL-CNN (Adaptive Learning Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification with results reported on a large-scale benchmark dataset which have been widely accepted for benchmarking test performance. The AL-CNN architecture integrates the use of both convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. This model was systematically trained on a subset of the dataset and then tested on an independent validation subset to test its efficiency and generalization capability. In addition, optimization techniques, including data augmentation, dropout, and advanced activation functions, were used to further enhance model performance. Results in terms of accuracy metrics indicated the successful execution of the AL-CNN model towards reliable and accurate image classification. This paper suggests the utility of AL-CNN technique to address various complexities of the problem of image classification, making room for innovations to take place in this domain.</p>",,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6204645/v1,English,Exclude,Outside date range,Enhancing Image Classification Accuracy with Adaptive Learning Convolutional Neural Network (AL-CNN): A Hybrid of AlexNet and LeNet Architectures,,,,,0.95,0.6,

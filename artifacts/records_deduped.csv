The demonstration of reproducible, spatially- and band-limited signal power changes has, consequently, attracted the interest of non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) research for a long time. BCIs often rely on motor imagery (MI) experimental paradigms that are expected to generate brain signal modulations analogous to movement-related ERD and ERS. However, a number of recent neuroscience studies has questioned the nature of these phenomena. Beta band activity has been shown to occur, on a single-trial level, in short, transient, and heterogeneous events termed bursts rather than sustained oscillations. In a previous study, we established that an analysis of hand MI binary classification tasks based on beta bursts can be superior to beta power in terms of classification score. In this article, we elaborate on this idea, proposing a signal processing algorithm that is comparable to- and compatible with state-of-the-art techniques. Our pipeline filters brain recordings by convolving them with kernels extracted from beta bursts and then applies spatial filtering before classification. This data-driven filtering allowed for a simple and efficient analysis of signals from multiple sensors, thus being suitable for online applications. By adopting a time-resolved decoding approach, we explored MI dynamics and showed the specificity of the new classification features. In accordance with previous results, beta bursts improved classification performance compared to beta band power, while often increasing information transfer rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40800536/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40800536/,English,Include,,Surfing beta burst waveforms to improve motor imagery-based BCI.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Although transfer learning (TL) offers a temporary solution, in scenarios requiring sustained knowledge transfer, the performance of TL-based models gradually declines as the number of transfers increases-a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel domain-incremental learning framework for the continual motor imagery (MI) EEG classification. Specifically, to learn and retain common features between subjects, we separate latent representations into subject-invariant and subject-specific features through adversarial training, while also proposing an extensible architecture to preserve features that are easily forgotten.

When all datasets were combined, there were no significant differences between most non-deep learning algorithms, with all having a mean AUC score of 0.64 or 0.65. All the non-deep learning algorithms significantly outperformed the deep learning algorithms, which can be partially attributed to a lack of hyperparameter tuning. The best of the deep learning algorithms was ShallowConvNet, with a mean AUC score of 0.57. Of the algorithms tested, only the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and ShallowConvNet exhibited significant age effects. This general lack of age effects, combined with examples of children as young as 6 having AUC scores as high as 0.8, provides evidence that young children are capable of producing measurable motor imagery activations. The age effects that were present for some algorithms suggest that the changing EEG patterns associated with development could have a measurable impact on classification algorithm outcomes, and such algorithms should be evaluated to ensure that they are not performing disproportionately poorly for younger children.

Although various machine learning methods have already proven useful to that effect, the use of many features and ineffective EEG channels often leads to a complex structure of classifier algorithms. State-of-the-art studies were interested in improving classification performance with complex feature extraction and classification methods by neglecting detailed EEG channel and feature investigation in predicting MI tasks from EEGs. Here, we investigate the effects of the statistically significant feature selection method on four different feature domains (time-domain, frequency-domain, time-frequency domain, and non-linear domain) and their two different combinations to reduce the number of features and classify MI-EEG features by comparing low-dimensional matrices with well-known machine learning algorithms. Our main goal is not to find the best classifier performance but to perform feature and channel investigation in MI task classification.

Utilizing sufficient EEG data from other subjects to aid in modeling the target subject presents a potential solution, commonly referred to as domain adaptation. Most current domain adaptation techniques for EEG decoding primarily focus on learning shared feature representations through domain alignment strategies. Since the domain shift cannot be completely removed, target EEG samples located near the edge of clusters are also susceptible to misclassification. We propose a novel adaptive deep feature representation (ADFR) framework to improve the cross-subject EEG classification performance through learning transferable EEG feature representations. Specifically, we first minimize the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains by employing maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) regularization, which aids in learning the shared feature representations. We then utilize the instance-based discriminative feature learning (IDFL) regularization to make the learned feature representations more discriminative. Finally, the entropy minimization (EM) regularization is further integrated to adjust the classifier to pass through the low-density region between clusters. The synergistic learning between above regularizations during the training process enhances EEG decoding performance across subjects. The effectiveness of the ADFR framework was evaluated on two public motor imagery (MI)-based EEG datasets: BCI Competition III dataset 4a and BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.

However, the procedure for performing a MI task for a single subject is subjective, making it difficult to determine the actual situation of an individual's MI task and resulting in significant individual EEG response variations during motion cognitive decoding. To explore this issue, we designed three visual stimuli (arrow, human, and robot), each of which was used to present three MI tasks (left arm, right arm, and feet), and evaluated differences in brain response in terms of ERD/S rhythms. To compare subject-specific variations of different visual stimuli, a novel cross-subject MI-EEG classification method was proposed for the three visual stimuli.

However, motor imagery EEG signals often have a low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial and temporal resolution. Traditional deep neural networks typically only focus on the spatial and temporal features of EEG, resulting in relatively low decoding and accuracy rates for motor imagery tasks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (P-3DCNN) decoding method that jointly learns spatial-frequency feature maps from the frequency and spatial domains of the EEG signals. First, the Welch method is used to calculate the frequency band power spectrum of the EEG, and a 2D matrix representing the spatial topology distribution of the electrodes is constructed. These spatial-frequency representations are then generated through cubic interpolation of the temporal EEG data. Next, the paper designs a 3DCNN network with 1D and 2D convolutional layers in series to optimize the convolutional kernel parameters and effectively learn the spatial-frequency features of the EEG. Batch normalization and dropout are also applied to improve the training speed and classification performance of the network. Finally, through experiments, the proposed method is compared to various classic machine learning and deep learning techniques.

Currently, deep learning (DL)-based methods are popular for EEG decoding. Whereas the utilization efficiency of EEG features in frequency and temporal domain is not sufficient, which results in poor MI classification performance. To address this issue, an EEG-based MI classification model based on a frequency enhancement module, a deformable convolutional network, and a crop module (FDCN-C) is proposed. Firstly, the frequency enhancement module is innovatively designed to address the issue of extracting frequency information. It utilizes convolution kernels at continuous time scales to extract features across different frequency bands. These features are screened by calculating attention and integrated into the original EEG data. Secondly, for temporal feature extraction, a deformable convolution network is employed to enhance feature extraction capabilities, utilizing offset parameters to modulate the convolution kernel size. In spatial domain, a one-dimensional convolution layer is designed to integrate all channel information. Finally, a dilated convolution is used to form a crop classification module, wherein the diverse receptive fields of the EEG data are computed multiple times. Two public datasets are employed to verify the proposed FDCN-C model, the classification accuracy obtained from the proposed model is greater than that of state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel model that uses the known information from multiple subjects to bolster EEG classification for an individual subject through adversarial learning strategies.

MI-BCI generally requires users to conduct the imagination of movement (e.g., left or right hand) to collect training data for generating a classification model during the calibration phase. However, this calibration phase is generally time-consuming and tedious, as users conduct the imagination of hand movement several times without being given feedback for an extended period. This obstacle makes MI-BCI non user-friendly and hinders its use. On the other hand, motor execution (ME) and motor observation (MO) are relatively easier tasks, yield lower fatigue than MI, and share similar neural mechanisms to MI. However, few studies have integrated these three tasks into BCIs. In this study, we propose a new task-to-task transfer learning approach of 3-motor tasks (ME, MO, and MI) for building a better user-friendly MI-BCI. For this study, 28 subjects participated in 3-motor tasks experiment, and electroencephalography (EEG) was acquired. User opinions regarding the 3-motor tasks were also collected through questionnaire survey. The 3-motor tasks showed a power decrease in the alpha rhythm, known as event-related desynchronization, but with slight differences in the temporal patterns. In the classification analysis, the cross-validated accuracy (within-task) was 67.05 % for ME, 65.93 % for MI, and 73.16 % for MO on average. Consistently with the results, the subjects scored MI (3.16) as the most difficult task compared with MO (1.42) and ME (1.41), with p < 0.05. In the analysis of task-to-task transfer learning, where training and testing are performed using different task datasets, the ME-trained model yielded an accuracy of 65.93 % (MI test), which is statistically similar to the within-task accuracy (p > 0.05).

Firstly, the rehabilitation movement was selected by SSVEP paradigm, and the multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method was used for SSVEP EEG recognition; then, the motion intention was obtained by MI paradigm, and the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory network (LSTM) were used to build a CNN-LSTM model for MI EEG recognition; finally, the recognition results were translated into control commands of Bowden cables to achieve multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation.Experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the CNN-LSTM model reaches to 90.07% ± 2.23%, and the overall accuracy of the hybrid EEG-based control approach reaches to 85.26% ± 1.95%. The twelve subjects involved in the usability assessment demonstrated an average system usability scale (SUS) score of 81.25 ± 5.82.

Moreover, the MI of phase-amplitude coupling in theta and beta bands positively correlated with hypoxia-related indices, including the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygenation desaturation index (ODI), and the percentage of oxygen saturation below 90% (SaO2<90%). OSA patients demonstrated increased MI values of theta phase and beta amplitude in the frontal and occipital regions during N1 sleep and wakefulness. This suggests that cortical coupling is prevalent and exhibits sleep-stage-specific patterns in OSA. Theta-beta PAC during N1 and wakefulness was positively correlated with hypoxia-related indices, suggesting a potential relationship between these neural oscillations and OSA severity. The present study provides new insights into the relationship between neural oscillations and respiratory hypoxia in OSA patients.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39323903/,English,Exclude,Not EEG-BCI focused,Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Theta and Beta Bands: A Potential Electrophysiological Marker for Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,,,,,0.9,0.6,

Of 4380 identified studies, 133 were included, only three enrolling children. The most common diagnosis was adult-onset stroke (77%). Paradigms mostly involved upper limb motor imagery or motor attempt. Common neurofeedback modes included visual, haptic and/or electrical stimulation. EEG parameters varied widely and were often incompletely described. Two studies applied augmentative strategies. Outcome measures varied widely and included classification accuracy of the Brain-Computer Interface, degree of enhancement of mu rhythm modulation or other neurophysiological parameters, and clinical/motor outcome scores. Few studies investigated whether functional outcomes related specifically to the EEG-based neurofeedback. There is limited evidence exploring EEG-based sensorimotor neurofeedback in individuals with movement disorders, especially in children. Further clarity of neurophysiological parameters is required to develop optimal paradigms for evaluating sensorimotor neurofeedback.

In this study, we aim to address the impact of non-stationarity, also known as inter-session variability, on multi-session MI classification performance by introducing a novel approach, the relevant session-transfer (RST) method. Leveraging the cosine similarity as a benchmark, the RST method transfers relevant EEG data from the previous session to the current one. The effectiveness of the proposed RST method was investigated through performance comparisons with the self-calibrating method, which uses only the data from the current session, and the whole-session transfer method, which utilizes data from all prior sessions. We validated the effectiveness of these methods using two datasets: a large MI public dataset (Shu Dataset) and our own dataset of gait-related MI, which includes both healthy participants and individuals with spinal cord injuries. Our experimental results revealed that the proposed RST method leads to a 2.29 % improvement (p < 0.001) in the Shu Dataset and up to a 6.37 % improvement in our dataset when compared to the self-calibrating method. Moreover, our method surpassed the performance of the recent highest-performing method that utilized the Shu Dataset, providing further support for the efficacy of the RST method in improving multi-session MI classification performance.

However, a mass of dipoles is inconvenient to extract the personalized features and requires a more complex neural network. In consideration of the structural and functional similarity of the neurons in a neuroanatomical region, i.e., a region of interest (ROI), we propose that the comprehensive performance of each ROI may be reflected by a specific representative dipole (RD), and the time-frequency spectrums of all RDs are applied simultaneously to Random Forest algorithm to give a quantitative metric of each ROI importance (RI). Then, the more divided sub-band spectral powers are reinforced by RI, and they are interpolated to a 2-dimensional (2D) plane transformed from 3D space of all RDs, yielding an ensemble representation of RD feature image sequences (ERDFIS). Furthermore, a lightweight network, including 2D separable convolution and gated recurrent unit (2DSCG), is developed to extract and classify the frequency-spatial and temporal features from ERDFIS, forming a novel MI decoding method in cortical level (called ERDFIS-2DSCG).

Therefore, we propose a trial-feedback paradigm to improve MI training and introduce a non-feedback paradigm for comparison. Each paradigm corresponds to one session. Two paradigms are applied to the calibration runs of corresponding sessions. And their effectiveness is verified in the subsequent testing runs of respective sessions.

EEG-based motor imagery (MI) plays a pivotal role in BCI, enabling the translation of thought into actionable commands for interactive and assistive technologies. However, the constrained decoding performance of brain signals poses a limitation to the broader application and development of BCI systems. In this study, we introduce a convolutional Transformer network (CTNet) designed for EEG-based MI classification. Firstly, CTNet employs a convolutional module analogous to EEGNet, dedicated to extracting local and spatial features from EEG time series. Subsequently, it incorporates a Transformer encoder module, leveraging a multi-head attention mechanism to discern the global dependencies of EEG's high-level features. Finally, a straightforward classifier module comprising fully connected layers is followed to categorize EEG signals. In subject-specific evaluations, CTNet achieved remarkable decoding accuracies of 82.52% and 88.49% on the BCI IV-2a and IV-2b datasets, respectively. Furthermore, in the challenging cross-subject assessments, CTNet achieved recognition accuracies of 58.64% on the BCI IV-2a dataset and 76.27% on the BCI IV-2b dataset.

The effective extraction of motor imagery features is vital due to the variability among individuals and temporal states. This study introduces a novel network architecture, 3D-convolutional neural network-generative adversarial network (3D-CNN-GAN), for decoding both within-session and cross-session motor imagery. Initially, EEG signals were extracted over various time intervals using a sliding window technique, capturing temporal, frequency, and phase features to construct a temporal-frequency-phase feature (TFPF) three-dimensional feature map. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were then employed to synthesize artificial data, which, when combined with the original datasets, expanded the data capacity and enhanced functional connectivity. Moreover, GANs proved capable of learning and amplifying the brain connectivity patterns present in the existing data, generating more distinctive brain network features. A compact, two-layer 3D-CNN model was subsequently developed to efficiently decode these TFPF features. Taking into account session and individual differences in EEG data, tests were conducted on both the public GigaDB dataset and the SHU laboratory dataset. On the GigaDB dataset, our 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-GAN models achieved two-class within-session motor imagery accuracies of 76.49% and 77.03%, respectively, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness and the improvement provided by data augmentation.

However, their clinical applicability remains difficulted by accuracy limitations and sensitivity to false activations. A proposed improvement involves integrating the BMI with methods based on detecting Error Related Potentials (ErrP) to self-tune erroneous commands and enhance not only the system accuracy, but also its usability. The aim of the current research is to characterize the ErrP at the beginning of the gait with a lower limb exoskeleton to reduce the false starts in the BMI system. Furthermore, this study is valuable for determining which type of feedback, Tactile, Visual, or Visuo-Tactile, achieves the best performance in evoking and detecting the ErrP. The initial phase of the research concentrates on detecting ErrP at the beginning of gait to improve the efficiency of an asynchronous BMI based on motor imagery (BMI-MI) to control a lower limb exoskeleton. Initially, an experimental protocol is designed to evoke ErrP at the start of gait, employing three different stimuli: Tactile, Visual, and Visuo-Tactile. An iterative selection process is then utilized to characterize ErrP in both time and frequency domains and fine-tune various parameters, including electrode distribution, feature combinations, and classifiers. A generic classifier with 6 subjects is employed to configure an ensemble classification system for detecting ErrP and reducing the false starts. The ensembled system configured with the selected parameters yields an average correction of false starts of 72.60 % ± 10.23, highlighting its corrective efficacy. Tactile feedback emerges as the most effective stimulus, outperforming Visual and Visuo-Tactile feedback in both training types. The results suggest promising prospects for reducing the false starts when integrating ErrP with BMI-MI, employing Tactile feedback. Consequently, the security of the system is enhanced. Subsequent, further research efforts will focus on detecting error potential during movement for gait stop, in order to limit undesired stops.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053352/,English,Exclude,Not EEG-BCI focused,Design of a brain-machine interface for reducing false activations of a lower-limb exoskeleton based on error related potential.,,,,,0.9,0.6,

Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has shown promising results in extracting EEG components associated with motor imagery tasks more effectively than traditional linear decomposition algorithms such as Fourier and wavelet methods. Nevertheless, the EMD-based algorithm suffers from a significant challenge known as mode mixing, where frequency components intertwine with the intrinsic mode functions obtained through EMD.

However, due to the lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of electroencephalograph (EEG), MI based BCI system that involves decoding hand movements within the same limb remains lower classification accuracy and poorer practicality. To overcome the limitations, an adaptive hybrid BCI system combining MI and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) is developed to improve decoding accuracy while enhancing neural engagement. On the one hand, the SSVEP evoked by visual stimuli based on action-state flickering coding approach significantly improves the recognition accuracy compared to the pure MI based BCI. On the other hand, to reduce the impact of SSVEP on MI due to the dual-task interference effect, the event-related desynchronization (ERD) based neural engagement is monitored and employed for feedback in real-time to ensure the effective execution of MI tasks.

In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation method called GPL, which simultaneously considers global knowledge and prototype-based local class information to enhance the classification accuracy of motor imagery signals. Depending on the amount of labeled data available in the target domain, the method is implemented in both unsupervised and semi-supervised versions. Specifically, at the global level, we employ the maximum mean difference (MMD) loss to globally constrain the feature space, achieving comprehensive alignment. In the context of class-level operations, we propose two memory banks designed to accommodate class prototypes in each domain and constrain feature embeddings by applying two prototype-based contrastive losses. The source contrastive loss is used to organize source features spatially based on categories, thereby reconciling inter-class and intra-class relationships, while the interactive contrastive loss is employed to facilitate cross-domain information interaction. Simultaneously, in unsupervised scenarios, to mitigate the adverse effects of excessive pseudo-labels, we introduce an entropy-aware strategy that dynamically evaluates the confidence level of target data and personalized constraints on the participation of interactive contrastive loss. To validate our approach, extensive experiments were conducted on a highly regarded public EEG dataset, namely Dataset IIa of the BCI Competition IV, as well as a large-scale EEG dataset called GigaDB.

Despite several efforts to utilize different features in EEG signals, a significant research challenge is using time-dependent features in combination with local and global features. Several attempts have been made to remodel the deep learning convolution neural networks (CNNs) to capture time-dependency information. These features are usually either handcrafted features, such as power ratios, or splitting data into smaller-sized windows related to specific properties, such as a peak at 300 ms. However, these approaches partially solve the problem but simultaneously hinder CNNs' capability to learn from unknown information that might be present in the data. Other approaches, like recurrent neural networks, are very suitable for learning time-dependent information from EEG signals in the presence of unrelated sequential data. To solve this, we have proposed an encoding kernel (EnK), a novel time-encoding approach, which uniquely introduces time decomposition information during the vertical convolution operation in CNNs. The encoded information lets CNNs learn time-dependent features in addition to local and global features.

To overwhelm this problem, a band power feature part-based convolutional neural network with African vulture optimization fostered channel selection for EEG classification (PCNNC-AVOACS-EEG) is proposed in this article. Initially, the input EEG signals are taken from BCI competition IV, dataset 1. Then the input EEG signals are pre-processed by contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization filtering.

However, the accurate recognition of MI patterns in electroencephalography signals (EEG) is hindered by several data-related limitations, which restrict the practical utilization of these systems. Moreover, leveraging deep learning (DL) models for MI decoding is challenged by the difficulty of accessing user-specific MI-EEG data on large scales. Simulated MI-EEG signals can be useful to address these issues, providing well-defined data for the validation of decoding models and serving as a data augmentation approach to improve the training of DL models. While substantial efforts have been dedicated to implementing effective data augmentation strategies and model-based EEG signal generation, the simulation of neurophysiologically plausible EEG-like signals has not yet been exploited in the context of data augmentation. Furthermore, none of the existing approaches have integrated user-specific neurophysiological information during the data generation process. Here, we present PySimMIBCI, a framework for generating realistic MI-EEG signals by integrating neurophysiologically meaningful activity into biophysical forward models. By means of PySimMIBCI, different user capabilities to control an MI-BCI can be simulated and fatigue effects can be included in the generated EEG.

How to effectively convert brain intentions into instructions for controlling external devices in real-time remains a key issue that needs to be addressed in brain computer interfaces. The Riemannian geometry-based methods have achieved competitive results in decoding EEG signals. However, current Riemannian classifiers tend to overlook changes in data distribution, resulting in degenerated classification performance in cross-session and/or cross subject scenarios. This paper proposes a brain signal decoding method based on Riemannian transfer learning, fully considering the drift of the data distribution. Two Riemannian transfer learning methods based log-Euclidean metric are developed, such that historical data (source domain) can be used to aid the training of the Riemannian decoder for the current task, or data from other subjects can be used to boost the training of the decoder for the target subject. The proposed methods were verified on BCI competition III, IIIa, and IV 2a datasets. Compared with the baseline that without transfer learning, the proposed algorithm demonstrates superior classification performance. In contrast to the Riemann transfer learning method based on the affine invariant Riemannian metric, the proposed method obtained comparable classification performance, but is much more computationally efficient.

Here, we combined EEG source reconstruction and Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods to construct large-scale cortical networks of left-hand and right-hand MI tasks. Compared to right-hand MI, the results showed that the significantly increased functional network connectivities (FNCs) mainly located among the visual network (VN), sensorimotor network (SMN), right temporal network, right central executive network, and right parietal network in the left-hand MI at the β (13-30Hz) and all (8-30Hz) frequency bands.

The communication between the brain and the computer or a machine is generally provided through Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals because they are cost-effective and easy to implement in normal life, not just in healthcare facilities. On the other hand, they are hard to process efficiently due to their nonlinearity and noisy nature. Thus, the field of BCI and EEG needs constant work and improvement. This paper focuses on generalizing the most efficient EEG channels and the most significant features of motor imagery (MI) signals by analyzing the recordings of one participant obtained over 20 different days. Because the classification performance usually decreases with an increasing number of class labels, we have realized the study by analyzing the signals through a new paradigm consisting of multi-class directional labels: right, left, forward, and backward. Afterward, the results are tested on EEG data obtained from 5 participants to see if the results are consistent with each other. The average accuracy of binary and multi-class classification using the Ensemble Subspace Discriminant classifier was found as 87.39 and 61.44%, respectively, with the most efficient 3-channel combination for daily BCI evaluation of one participant. On the other hand, the average accuracy of binary and multi-class classification was found as 71.84 and 50.42%, respectively, for 5 participants, with the most efficient channel combination of 4, where the first three are the same as the daily performance of one participant. During signal processing, the outliers of the signals were discarded by considering the channels separately. An algorithm was developed to dismiss the inconsistent samples within the classes. A novel adaptive filtering approach, correlation-based adaptive variational mode decomposition (CBAVMD), was proposed.

The model is trained with augmented electroencephalography (EEG) data to learn deep features for MI classification. To address the sensitivity issue of the initial model weights to classification performance, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to determine the convolution kernel parameters for each layer of the EEGNet network, followed by optimization of the network weights through backpropagation.

This paper presents an entropy-based approach to select effective EEG channels for motor imagery (MI) classification in brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. The method identifies channels with higher entropy scores, which is an indication of greater information content. It discards redundant or noisy channels leading to reduced computational complexity and improved classification accuracy. High entropy means a more disordered pattern, whereas low entropy means a less disordered pattern with less information. The entropy of each channel for individual trials is calculated. The weight of each channel is represented by the mean entropy of the channel over all the trials. A set of channels with higher mean entropy are selected as effective channels for MI classification.

By integrating the enhanced adaptive L1 penalty and weighted fusion penalty into the sparse learning model, we select the most informative features from the matrix. Specifically, we measure the importance of features using mutual information and introduce an adaptive weight construction strategy to penalize regression coefficients corresponding to each variable adaptively. Moreover, the weighted fusion penalty balances weight differences among correlated variables, reducing the model's overreliance on specific variables and enhancing accuracy. The performance of the proposed method was validated on BCI Competition IV datasets IIa and IIb using the support vector machine.

Motor imagery (MI) classification using EEG signals is an important application that can help a rehabilitated or motor-impaired stroke patient perform certain tasks. Robust classification of these signals is an important step toward making the use of EEG more practical in many applications and less dependent on trained professionals. Deep learning methods have produced impressive results in BCI in recent years, especially with the availability of large electroencephalography (EEG) data sets. Dealing with EEG-MI signals is difficult because noise and other signal sources can interfere with the electrical amplitude of the brain, and its generalization ability is limited, so it is difficult to improve EEG classifiers. To address these issues, this paper presents a methodology based on one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNN) for motor imagery (MI) recognition for the right hand, left hand, feet, and sedentary task.

Experiments on eight public EEG datasets across four different BCI paradigms (motor imagery, steady-state visual evoked potential, P300, and seizure classifications) using different decoding algorithms demonstrated that: (1) CR is effective, i.e., it can noticeably improve the classification accuracy; (2) CR is robust, i.e., it consistently outperforms existing data augmentation approaches in the literature; and, (3) CR is flexible, i.e., it can be combined with other data augmentation approaches to further improve the performance.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI systems employ electrodes to measure the electrical brain activity projected at the scalp and discern patterns. However, the volume conduction problem attenuates the electric potential from the brain to the scalp and introduces spatial mixing to the signals. EEG source imaging (ESI) techniques can be applied to alleviate these issues and enhance the spatial segregation of information. Despite this potential solution, the use of ESI has not been extensively applied in BCI systems, largely due to accuracy concerns over reconstruction accuracy when using low-density EEG (ldEEG), which is commonly used in BCIs. To overcome these accuracy issues in low channel counts, recent studies have proposed reducing the number of EEG channels based on optimized channel selection. This work presents an evaluation of the spatial and temporal accuracy of ESI when applying optimized channel selection towards ldEEG number of channels. For this, a simulation study of source activity related to hand movement has been performed using as a starting point an EEG system with 339 channels. The results obtained after optimization show that the activity in the concerned areas can be retrieved with a spatial accuracy of 3.99, 10.69, and 14.29 mm (localization error) when using 32, 16, and 8 channel counts respectively.

However, due to the limited perceptual field of convolutional kernel, CNN only extracts features from local region without considering long-term dependencies for EEG decoding. Apart from long-term dependencies, multi-modal temporal information is equally important for EEG decoding because it can offer a more comprehensive understanding of the temporal dynamics of neural processes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network that combines CNN with self-attention mechanism to encapsulate multi-modal temporal information and global dependencies. The network first extracts multi-modal temporal information from two distinct perspectives: average and variance. A shared self-attention module is then designed to capture global dependencies along these two feature dimensions. We further design a convolutional encoder to explore the relationship between average-pooled and variance-pooled features and fuse them into more discriminative features.

In this paper, we aim to investigate brain-to-brain coupling during motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) training using eye-contact and hand-touch interaction. Twelve pairs of friends (experimental group) and 10 pairs of strangers (control group) were recruited for MI-based BCI tests concurrent with electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) was estimated to measure cortical activation, and interbrain functional connectivity was assessed using multilevel statistical analysis. Furthermore, we compared BCI classification performance under different social interaction conditions. In the experimental group, greater ERD was found around the contralateral sensorimotor cortex under social interaction conditions compared with MI without any social interaction. Notably, EEG channels with decreased power were mainly distributed around the frontal, central, and occipital regions. A significant increase in interbrain coupling was also found under social interaction conditions. BCI decoding accuracies were significantly improved in the eye contact condition and eye and hand contact condition compared with the no-interaction condition. However, for the strangers' group, no positive effects were observed in comparisons of cortical activations between interaction and no-interaction conditions. These findings indicate that social interaction can improve the neural synchronization between familiar partners with enhanced brain activations and brain-to-brain coupling.

This phenomenon greatly affects the applicability of adversarial defense approaches to EEG-based BCIs. To mitigate this problem, we propose alignment-based adversarial training (ABAT), which performs EEG data alignment before adversarial training. Data alignment aligns EEG trials from different domains to reduce their distribution discrepancies, and adversarial training further robustifies the classification boundary.

In contrast to these systems, Imagined speech based BCI systems rely on directly decoding the vowels/words user is thinking, making them more intuitive, user friendly and highly popular among Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) researchers. However, more research needs to be conducted on how subject-specific characteristics such as mental state, age, handedness, nativeness and resting state activity affects the brain's output during imagined speech. In an overt speech, it is evident that native and non-native speakers' brains function differently. Therefore, this paper explores how nativeness to language affects EEG signals while imagining vowel phonemes, using brain-map analysis and scalogram and also investigates the inclusion of features extracted from resting state EEG with imagined state EEG. The Fourteen-channel EEG for Imagined Speech (FEIS) dataset was used to analyse the EEG signals recorded while imagining vowel phonemes for 16 subjects (nine native English and seven non-native Chinese). For the classification of vowel phonemes, different connectivity measures such as covariance, coherence, and Phase Synchronous Index-PSI were extracted and analysed using statistics based Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) approach.

This time-span requirement of the training samples makes real-time MI BCI systems impossible to implement based on deep networks, which restricts the related researches within laboratory and makes practical application hard to accomplish. To address this issue, a double-point observation deep network (DoNet) is developed to classify ultra-short samples buried in noise. First, an analytical solution is developed theoretically to perform ultra-short signal classification based on double-point couples. Then, a signal-noise model is constructed to study the interference of noise on classification based on double-point couples. Based on which, an independent identical distribution condition is utilized to improve the classification accuracy in a data-driven manner. Combining the theoretical model and data-driven mechanism, DoNet can construct a steady data-distribution for the double-point couples of the samples with the same label.

We propose a new framework based on the augmented covariance that stems from an autoregressive model to improve motor imagery classification. From the autoregressive model can be derived the Yule-Walker equations, which show the emergence of a symmetric positive definite matrix: the augmented covariance matrix. The state-of the art for classifying covariance matrices is based on Riemannian Geometry. A fairly natural idea is therefore to apply this Riemannian Geometry based approach to these augmented covariance matrices. The methodology for creating the augmented covariance matrix shows a natural connection with the delay embedding theorem proposed by Takens for dynamical systems. Such an embedding method is based on the knowledge of two parameters: the delay and the embedding dimension, respectively related to the lag and the order of the autoregressive model. This approach provides new methods to compute the hyper-parameters in addition to standard grid search. The augmented covariance matrix performed ACMs better than any state-of-the-art methods. We will test our approach on several datasets and several subjects using the MOABB framework, using both within-session and cross-session evaluation. The improvement in results is due to the fact that the augmented covariance matrix incorporates not only spatial but also temporal information. As such, it contains information on the nonlinear components of the signal through the embedding procedure, which allows the leveraging of dynamical systems algorithms.

In recent years, prominent research has focused on enhancing the accuracy of BCI decoding algorithms by effectively utilizing meaningful features extracted from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This paper proposes a method for extracting brain functional network features based on directed transfer function (DTF) and graph theory. The method incorporates the extracted brain network features with common spatial pattern (CSP) to enhance the performance of motor imagery (MI) classification task. The signals from each electrode of the EEG, utilizing a total of 32 channels, are used as input signals for the network nodes. In this study, 26 healthy participants were recruited to provide EEG data. The brain functional network is constructed in Alpha and Beta bands using the DTF method. The node degree (ND), clustering coefficient (CC), and global efficiency (GE) of the brain functional network are obtained using graph theory. The DTF network features and graph theory are combined with the traditional signal processing method, the CSP algorithm. The redundant network features are filtered out using the Lasso method, and finally, the fused features are classified using a support vector machine (SVM), culminating in a novel approach we have termed CDGL. For Beta frequency band, with 8 electrodes, the proposed CDGL method achieved an accuracy of 89.13%, a sensitivity of 90.15%, and a specificity of 88.10%, which are 14.10, 16.69, and 11.50% percentage higher than the traditional CSP method (75.03, 73.46, and 76.60%), respectively.

Similar results were also obtained on two public datasets, where the CDGL algorithm's performance was found to be optimal. The feature fusion of DTF network and graph theory features enhanced CSP algorithm's performance in MI task classification.

The experimental protocol to evaluate the BMI was designed as asynchronous, allowing subjects to perform mental tasks at their own will. A total of five healthy able-bodied subjects were enrolled in this study to participate in a series of experimental sessions. The brain signals from two of these sessions were used to develop a generic deep learning model through transfer learning. Subsequently, this model was fine-tuned during the remaining sessions and subjected to evaluation. Three distinct deep learning approaches were compared: one that did not undergo fine-tuning, another that fine-tuned all layers of the model, and a third one that fine-tuned only the last three layers. The evaluation phase involved the exclusive closed-loop control of the exoskeleton device by the participants' neural activity using the second deep learning approach for the decoding. The three deep learning approaches were assessed in comparison to an approach based on spatial features that was trained for each subject and experimental session, demonstrating their superior performance. Interestingly, the deep learning approach without fine-tuning achieved comparable performance to the features-based approach, indicating that a generic model trained on data from different individuals and previous sessions can yield similar efficacy.

This paper presents a multi-scale spatiotemporal self-attention (SA) network model that relies on an attention mechanism. This model aims to classify motor imagination EEG signals into four classes (left hand, right hand, foot, tongue/rest) by considering the temporal and spatial properties of EEG. It is employed to autonomously allocate greater weights to channels linked to motor activity and lesser weights to channels not related to movement, thus choosing the most suitable channels. Neuron utilises parallel multi-scale Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers to extract feature information in the temporal domain at various scales, effectively eliminating temporal domain noise.

Domain adaptation, however, is most often performed on sample covariance matrices (SCMs) obtained from EEG data, and thus might not fully account for components affecting covariance estimation itself, such as regional trends. Detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) can be utilized to estimate the covariance structure of such signals, yet it is computationally expensive in its original form. A recently proposed online implementation of DCCA, however, allows for its fast computation and thus makes it possible to employ DCCA in real-time applications. In this study we propose to replace the SCM with the DCCA matrix as input to RGBC and assess its effect on offline and online BCI performance. First we evaluated the proposed decoding pipeline offline on previously recorded EEG data from 18 individuals performing left and right hand motor imagery (MI), and benchmarked it against vanilla RGBC and popular MI-detection approaches. Subsequently, we recruited eight participants (with previous BCI experience) who operated an MI-based BCI (MI-BCI) online using the DCCA-enhanced Riemannian decoder. Finally, we tested the proposed method on a public, multi-class MI-BCI dataset. During offline evaluations the DCCA-based decoder consistently and significantly outperformed the other approaches. Online evaluation confirmed that the DCCA matrix could be computed in real-time even for 22-channel EEG, as well as subjects could control the MI-BCI with high command delivery (normalized Cohen's κ: 0.7409 ± 0.1515) and sample-wise MI detection (normalized Cohen's κ: 0.5200 ± 0.1610).

Furthermore, inter-class variance among these frequency bands and the limited number of available EEG channels can adversely affect the CSP algorithm's ability to extract meaningful features from the relevant signal frequency bands. We hypothesize that multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFS), into which the raw EEG signal is decomposed, can better capture the non-Gaussian characteristics of the signal, thus compensating for the limitations of the CSP algorithm when dealing with nonlinear and non-Gaussian distributed data with few channels.

Comparative analysis with MEMD on simulation data and real-world EEG validates the above assertions. The joint average frequency measure is employed to automatically select intrinsic mode functions that correspond to specific frequency bands.

On the Physiobank Motor/Mental Imagery dataset and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, FMEMD-based architecture also attained a comparable performance to complex algorithms.

The visibility graph (VG) is a robust algorithm for analyzing complex systems such as the brain. Direct Lingam uses a non-Gaussian model to extract causal links which is appropriate for analyzing large-scale connectivity. First, LPHVG map MI-EEG (electroencephalogram) signals into networks. After extracting the topological features of the networks, a support vector machine classifier was applied to categorize multi-classes MI.

Among the various research topics in BCIs, the classification of motor imagery using electroencephalography (EEG) signals has the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for people with disabilities. This technology assists them in controlling computers or other devices like prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and drones. However, the current performance of EEG signal decoding is not sufficient for real-world applications based on Motor Imagery EEG (MI-EEG). To address this issue, this study proposes an attention-based bidirectional feature pyramid temporal convolutional network model for the classification task of MI-EEG. The model incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to weigh significant features in the MI-EEG signals. It also utilizes a temporal convolution network (TCN) to separate high-level temporal features. The signals are enhanced using the sliding-window technique, and channel and time-domain information of the MI-EEG signals is extracted through convolution. Additionally, a bidirectional feature pyramid structure is employed to implement attention mechanisms across different scales and multiple frequency bands of the MI-EEG signals. The performance of our model is evaluated on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset and the BCI Competition IV-2b dataset, and the results showed that our model outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline model, with an accuracy of 87.5 and 86.3% for the subject-dependent, respectively. In conclusion, the BFATCNet model offers a novel approach for EEG-based motor imagery classification in BCIs, effectively capturing relevant features through attention mechanisms and temporal convolutional networks. Its superior performance on the BCI Competition IV-2a and IV-2b datasets highlights its potential for real-world applications. However, its performance on other datasets may vary, necessitating further research on data augmentation techniques and integration with multiple modalities to enhance interpretability and generalization.

Inspired by the optimal transport theory, this study aims to develop a novel three-stage transfer learning (TSTL) method, which uses the existing labeled data from a source domain to improve classification performance on an unlabeled target domain.

The RTSM maps a symmetric positive definite matrix from the Riemannian space to the tangent space to minimize the marginal probability distribution drift. The SDT transforms the source domain to a target domain by finding the optimal transport mapping matrix to reduce the joint probability distribution differences. The OSM finally maps the transformed source domain and original target domain to the same subspace to further mitigate the distribution discrepancy.

However, the underlying brain mechanisms of MI remain not well understood. Most MI-BCIs use the sensorimotor rhythms elicited in the primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory cortex (S1), which consist of an event-related desynchronization followed by an event-related synchronization. Consequently, this has resulted in systems that only record signals around M1 and S1. However, MI could involve a more complex network including sensory, association, and motor areas. In this study, we hypothesize that the superior accuracies achieved by new deep learning (DL) models applied to MI decoding rely on focusing on a broader MI activation of the brain. Parallel to the success of DL, the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has seen continuous development to provide explanations for DL networks success. The goal of this study is to use XAI in combination with DL to extract information about MI brain activation patterns from non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We applied an adaptation of Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to EEGSym, a state-of-the-art DL network with exceptional transfer learning capabilities for inter-subject MI classification. We obtained the SHAP values from two public databases comprising 171 users generating left and right hand MI instances with and without real-time feedback. We found that EEGSym based most of its prediction on the signal of the frontal electrodes, i.e. F7 and F8, and on the first 1500 ms of the analyzed imagination period. We also found that MI involves a broad network not only based on M1 and S1, but also on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). We further applied this knowledge to select a 8-electrode configuration that reached inter-subject accuracies of 86.5% ± 10.6% on the Physionet dataset and 88.7% ± 7.0% on the Carnegie Mellon University's dataset.

Since EEG recordings suffer from heterogeneity across subjects and labeled data insufficiency, designing a classifier that performs the MI independently from the subject with limited labeled samples would be desirable. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel subject-independent semi-supervised deep architecture (SSDA). The proposed SSDA consists of two parts: an unsupervised and a supervised element. The training set contains both labeled and unlabeled data samples from multiple subjects. First, the unsupervised part, known as the columnar spatiotemporal auto-encoder (CST-AE), extracts latent features from all the training samples by maximizing the similarity between the original and reconstructed data. A dimensional scaling approach is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the representations while preserving their discriminability. Second, a supervised part learns a classifier based on the labeled training samples using the latent features acquired in the unsupervised part. Moreover, we employ center loss in the supervised part to minimize the embedding space distance of each point in a class to its center. The model optimizes both parts of the network in an end-to-end fashion. The performance of the proposed SSDA is evaluated on test subjects who were not seen by the model during the training phase.

Motor imagery (MI) has been a popular paradigm in BCI control where the user imagines movements of e.g., their left and right limbs and classifiers are then trained to detect such intent directly from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. For some users, however, it is difficult to elicit patterns in the EEG signal that can be detected with existing features and classifiers. As such, new user control strategies and training paradigms have been highly sought-after to help improve motor imagery performance. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as one potential tool where improvements in user engagement and level of immersion have shown to improve BCI accuracy. Motor priming in VR, in turn, has shown to further enhance BCI accuracy. In this pilot study, we take the first steps to explore if multisensory VR motor priming, where haptic and olfactory stimuli are present, can improve motor imagery detection efficacy in terms of both improved accuracy and faster detection. Experiments with 10 participants equipped with a biosensor-embedded VR headset, an off-the-shelf scent diffusion device, and a haptic glove with force feedback showed that significant improvements in motor imagery detection could be achieved. Increased activity in the six common spatial pattern filters used were also observed and peak accuracy could be achieved with analysis windows that were 2 s shorter. Combined, the results suggest that multisensory motor priming prior to motor imagery could improve detection efficacy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38236517/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38236517/,English,Include,,Enhancing motor imagery detection efficacy using multisensory virtual reality priming.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.8,small_sample_mentioned

Though numerous research groups and institutes collect a multitude of EEG datasets for the same BCI task, sharing EEG data from multiple sites is still challenging due to the heterogeneity of devices. The significance of this challenge cannot be overstated, given the critical role of data diversity in fostering model robustness. However, existing works rarely discuss this issue, predominantly centering their attention on model training within a single dataset, often in the context of inter-subject or inter-session settings. In this work, we propose a hierarchical personalized Federated Learning EEG decoding (FLEEG) framework to surmount this challenge. This innovative framework heralds a new learning paradigm for BCI, enabling datasets with disparate data formats to collaborate in the model training process. Each client is assigned a specific dataset and trains a hierarchical personalized model to manage diverse data formats and facilitate information exchange. Meanwhile, the server coordinates the training procedure to harness knowledge gleaned from all datasets, thus elevating overall performance. The framework has been evaluated in Motor Imagery (MI) classification with nine EEG datasets collected by different devices but implementing the same MI task. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework can boost classification performance up to 8.4% by enabling knowledge sharing between multiple datasets, especially for smaller datasets. Visualization results also indicate that the proposed framework can empower the local models to put a stable focus on task-related areas, yielding better performance.

However, many EEG-based datasets are often plagued by the issue of high inter-subject signal variability. Robust deep learning models are notoriously difficult to train under such scenarios, often leading to subpar or widely varying performance across subjects under the leave-one-subject-out paradigm. Recently, the model agnostic meta-learning framework was introduced as a way to increase the model's ability to generalize towards new tasks. While the original framework focused on task-based meta-learning, this research aims to show that the meta-learning methodology can be modified towards subject-based signal classification while maintaining the same task objectives and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Namely, we propose the novel implementation of a few/zero-shot subject-independent meta-learning framework towards multi-class inner speech and binary class motor imagery classification. Compared to current subject-adaptive methods which utilize large number of labels from the target, the proposed framework shows its effectiveness in training zero-calibration and few-shot models for subject-independent EEG classification. The proposed few/zero-shot subject-independent meta-learning mechanism performs well on both small and large datasets and achieves robust, generalized performance across subjects.

In view of the individual differences of subjects in motor imagery tasks, this article proposes a Time Segment Adaptive Optimization method based on Separability criterion and Correlation analysis (TSAOSC). The fundamental principle of this method involves applying the separability criterion to various sizes of time windows within the training data, identifying the optimal raw reference signal, and adaptively adjusting the time segment position for each trial's data by analyzing its relationship with the optimal reference signal. We evaluated our method on three BCI competition datasets, respectively. The utilization of the TSAOSC method in the experiments resulted in an enhancement of 4.90% in average classification accuracy compared to its absence.

Many studies have focused on the traditional spatial filters obtained through the common spatial pattern (CSP) method. However, the CSP method can only obtain fixed spatial filters for specific input signals. In addition, the CSP method only focuses on the variance difference of two types of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, so the decoding ability of EEG signals is limited. To make up for these deficiencies, this study introduces a novel spatial filter-solving paradigm named adaptive spatial pattern (ASP), which aims to minimize the energy intra-class matrix and maximize the inter-class matrix of MI-EEG after spatial filtering. The filter bank adaptive and common spatial pattern (FBACSP), our proposed method for MI-EEG decoding, amalgamates ASP spatial filters with CSP features across multiple frequency bands. Through a dual-stage feature selection strategy, it employs the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm for spatial filter optimization, surpassing traditional CSP approaches in MI classification. To streamline feature sets and enhance recognition efficiency, it first prunes CSP features in each frequency band using mutual information, followed by merging these with ASP features. Comparative experiments are conducted on two public datasets (2a and 2b) from BCI competition IV, which show the outstanding average recognition accuracy of FBACSP. The classification accuracy of the proposed method has reached 74.61 and 81.19% on datasets 2a and 2b, respectively. Compared with the baseline algorithm, filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), the proposed algorithm improves by 11.44 and 7.11% on two datasets, respectively ( It is demonstrated that FBACSP has a strong ability to decode MI-EEG.

Rare and equiprobable conditions were set for MI blocks. Central- and surrounding-deviant stimuli were presented with low probabilities in the rare condition and with identical probabilities to that of typical stimuli in the equiprobable condition. Deviant processing was evaluated by comparing between event-related potentials in rare and equiprobable conditions.

Each model computed speech information for these nursery rhymes in two different low-frequency bands, delta and theta, thought to provide different types of linguistic information. All three models demonstrated significant levels of performance for delta-band neural activity from 4 months of age, with two of three models also showing significant performance for theta-band activity. All models also demonstrated higher accuracy for the delta-band neural responses. None of the models showed developmental (age-related) effects. The data demonstrate that the choice of algorithm used to decode speech envelope information from neural activity in the infant brain determines the developmental conclusions that can be drawn. The modelling shows that better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each modelling approach is fundamental to improving our understanding of how the human brain builds a language system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128783/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38128783/,English,Include,,"Decoding speech information from EEG data with 4-, 7- and 11-month-old infants: Using convolutional neural network, mutual information-based and backward linear models.",Include,,"tational models that successfully decode neural activity into speech are increasing in the adult literature, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), backward linear models, and mutual information (MI) models all being applied to neural data in relation to speech input.

However, cerebral cortical potentials are highly rhythmic and sub-band features, different experimental situations and subjects have different categories of semantic information in specific sample target spaces. Feature fusion can lead to more discriminative features, but simple fusion of features from different embedding spaces leading to the model global loss is not easily convergent and ignores the complementarity of features. Considering the similarity and category contribution of different sub-band features, we propose a multi-band centroid contrastive reconstruction fusion network (MB-CCRF). We obtain multi-band spatio-temporal features by frequency division, preserving the task-related rhythmic features of different EEG signals; use a multi-stream cross-layer connected convolutional network to perform a deep feature representation for each sub-band separately; propose a centroid contrastive reconstruction fusion module, which maps different sub-band and category features into the same shared embedding space by comparing with category prototypes, reconstructing the feature semantic structure to ensure that the global loss of the fused features converges more easily. Finally, we use a learning mechanism to model the similarity between channel features and use it as the weight of fused sub-band features, thus enhancing the more discriminative features, suppressing the useless features. The experimental accuracy is 79.96% in the BCI competition Ⅳ-Ⅱa dataset. Moreover, the classification effect of sub-band features of different subjects is verified by comparison tests, the category propensity of different sub-band features is verified by confusion matrix tests and the distribution in different classes of each sub-band feature and fused feature are showed by visual analysis, revealing the importance of different sub-band features for the EEG-based MI classification task.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38124568/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38124568/,English,Include,,A multi-band centroid contrastive reconstruction fusion network for motor imagery electroencephalogram signal decoding.,Include,,Motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) assist users in establishing direct communication between their brain and external devices by decoding the movement intention of human electroencephal,,0.95,0.6,

Many methods have been proposed to evaluate the vulnerability of such CNN models, primarily by attacking them using direct temporal perturbations. In this work, we propose a novel attacking approach based on perturbations in the frequency domain instead. For a given natural MI trial in the frequency domain, the proposed approach, called frequency domain channel-wise attack (FDCA), generates perturbations at each channel one after another to fool the CNN classifiers. The advances of this strategy are two-fold. First, instead of focusing on the temporal domain, perturbations are generated in the frequency domain where discriminative patterns can be extracted for motor imagery (MI) classification tasks. Second, the perturbing optimization is performed based on differential evolution algorithm in a black-box scenario where detailed model knowledge is not required. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDCA which achieves a significantly higher success rate than the baselines and existing methods in attacking three major CNN classifiers on four public MI benchmarks. Perturbations generated in the frequency domain yield highly competitive results in attacking MIBCI deployed by CNN models even in a black-box setting, where the model information is well-protected. To our best knowledge, existing MIBCI attack approaches are all gradient-based methods and require details about the victim model, e.g., the parameters and objective function.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a new scheme equipped with attention-based dual-scale fusion convolutional neural network (ADFCNN), which jointly extracts and fuses EEG spectral and spatial information at different scales. This scheme also provides novel insight through self-attention for effective information fusion from different scales. Specifically, temporal convolutions with two different kernel sizes identify EEG μ and β rhythms, while spatial convolutions at two different scales generate global and detailed spatial information, respectively, and the self-attention mechanism performs feature fusion based on the internal similarity of the concatenated features extracted by the dual-scale CNN.

However, only a few MI-EEG classification methods have been recently been applied to BCIs, mainly because they suffered from sample variability across subjects. To address this issue, the cross-subject scenario based on domain adaptation has been widely investigated. However, existing methods often encounter problems such as redundant features and incorrect pseudo-label predictions in the target domain. To achieve high performance cross-subject MI-EEG classification, this paper proposes a novel method called Dual Selections based Knowledge Transfer Learning (DS-KTL). DS-KTL selects both discriminative features from the source domain and corrects pseudo-labels from the target domain. The DS-KTL method applies centroid alignment to the samples initially, and then adopts Riemannian tangent space features for feature adaptation. During feature adaptation, dual selections are performed with regularizations, which enhance the classification performance during iterations. Empirical studies conducted on two benchmark MI-EEG datasets demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method under multi-source to single-target and single-source to single-target cross-subject strategies.

In fact, in BCI paradigms, if two trials are separated by a few seconds, taking a baseline close to the end of the previous trial could result in an over-estimation of the ERD, while taking a baseline too close to the upcoming trial could result in an under-estimation of the ERD.

It is invariant under translation and time reparametrization, which makes it a robust feature for multichannel EEG time series. The performance can be further boosted by combining the path signature with the gold standard Riemannian classifier in the BCI field exploiting the geometric structure of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The results obtained on publicly available datasets show that the signature method is more robust to inter-user variability than classical ones, especially on noisy and low-quality data. Hence, this study paves the way towards the use of mathematical tools that until now have been neglected, in order to tackle the EEG-based BCI variability issue. It also sheds light on the lead-lag relationship captured by path signature which seems relevant to assess the underlying neural mechanisms.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38049438/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38049438/,English,Include,,Signature methods for brain-computer interfaces.,Exclude,Duplicate study,Duplicate group,,0.99,0.6,

However, these temporal-frequency-spatial features are high-dimensional small-sample data, which poses significant challenges for motor imagery decoding. Sparse regularization is an effective method for addressing this issue. However, the most commonly employed sparse regularization models in motor imagery decoding, such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), is a biased estimation method and leads to the loss of target feature information. In this paper, we propose a non-convex sparse regularization model that employs the Cauchy function. By designing a proximal gradient algorithm, our proposed model achieves closer-to-unbiased estimation than existing sparse models. Therefore, it can learn more accurate, discriminative, and effective feature information. Additionally, the proposed method can perform feature selection and classification simultaneously, without requiring additional classifiers. We conducted experiments on two publicly available motor imagery EEG datasets. The proposed method achieved an average classification accuracy of 82.98% and 64.45% in subject-dependent and subject-independent decoding assessment methods, respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of motor imagery decoding, with better classification performance than existing feature selection and deep learning methods. Furthermore, the proposed model shows better generalization capability, with parameter consistency over different datasets and robust classification across different training sample sizes.

Its weak potential difference changes make it easy to be overwhelmed by noise, and the EEG acquisition method has a natural limitation of low spatial resolution. These have brought significant obstacles to high-precision recognition, especially the recognition of the motion intention of the same upper limb. This research proposes a method that combines signal traceability and Riemannian geometric features to identify six motor intentions of the same upper limb, including grasping/holding of the palm, flexion/extension of the elbow, and abduction/adduction of the shoulder. First, the EEG data of electrodes irrelevant to the task were screened out by low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography. Subsequently, tangential spatial features are extracted by the Riemannian geometry framework in the covariance matrix estimated from the reconstructed EEG signals. The learned Riemannian geometric features are used for pattern recognition by a support vector machine with a linear kernel function. The average accuracy of the six classifications on the data set of 15 participants is 22.47%, the accuracy is 19.34% without signal traceability, the accuracy is 18.07% when the features are the filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), and the accuracy is 16.7% without signal traceability and characterized by FBCSP.

CSP algorithm embeds the dimensionality of multichannel EEG data to extract features of motor imagery tasks. Most previous studies focused on the optimization of the time domain and the spectrum domain of EEG signal to improve the effectiveness of CSP, whereas ignoring the constraint on the projected feature space. This study proposed a variance characteristic preserving CSP (VPCSP) that is modified by a regularization item based on graph theory. Specifically, we calculated the loss of abnormalities of the projected data while preserving the variance characteristic locally. Then the loss could be rewritten as a matrix with the introduction of the Laplace matrix, which turned it into a generalized eigenvalue problem equivalent to CSP. This study evaluated the proposed method on two public EEG datasets from the BCI competition. The modified method could extract robust and distinguishable features that provided higher classification performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed regularization improved the effectiveness of CSP significantly and achieved superior performance compared with reported modified CSP algorithms significantly.

Successful decoding of these bio-signals is however non-trivial because of the time-varying and non-stationary characteristics. Furthermore, existence of short- and long-range dependencies in these time-series signal makes the decoding even more challenging. State-of-the-art studies proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based architectures for the classification of these bio-signals, which are proven useful to learn spatial representations. However, CNNs because of the fixed size convolutional kernels and shared weights pay only uniform attention and are also suboptimal in learning short-long term dependencies, simultaneously, which could be pivotal in decoding EEG and EMG signals. Therefore, it is important to address these limitations of CNNs. To learn short- and long-range dependencies simultaneously and to pay more attention to more relevant part of the input signal, Transformer neural network-based architectures can play a significant role. Nonetheless, it requires a large corpus of training data. However, EEG and EMG decoding studies produce limited amount of the data. Therefore, using standalone transformers neural networks produce ordinary results. In this study, we ask a question whether we can fix the limitations of CNN and transformer neural networks and provide a robust and generalized model that can simultaneously learn spatial patterns, long-short term dependencies, pay variable amount of attention to time-varying non-stationary input signal with limited training data. In this work, we introduce a novel single hybrid model called ConTraNet, which is based on CNN and Transformer architectures that contains the strengths of both CNN and Transformer neural networks. ConTraNet uses a CNN block to introduce inductive bias in the model and learn local dependencies, whereas the Transformer block uses the self-attention mechanism to learn the short- and long-range or global dependencies in the signal and learn to pay different attention to different parts of the signals.

In this research, we propose 3D-EEGNet as a 3D CNN model to improve both the explainability and performance of MI EEG classification. The proposed approach exhibited better performances on two MI EEG datasets than the existing EEGNet, which uses a 2D input shape.

Recently, a lot of efforts have been made to improve MI signal classification using a combination of signal decomposition and machine learning techniques but they fail to perform adequately on large multi-class datasets. Previously, researchers have implemented long short-term memory (LSTM), which is capable of learning the time-series information, on the MI-EEG dataset for motion recognition.

The VR-ULE system makes use of the MI electroencephalogram (EEG) recognition model with a convolutional neural network and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to obtain the patient's motion intentions and control the exoskeleton to move during rehabilitation training movement. Due to the individual differences in EEG, the frequency bands with optimal MI EEG features for each patient are different. Therefore, the weight of different feature channels is learned by combining SE blocks to emphasize the useful information frequency band features. The MI cues in the VR-based virtual scenes can improve the interhemispheric balance and the neuroplasticity of patients.

However, there is still limited knowledge about how the brain's functional networks reorganize in response to such feedback. To address this gap, this study investigates the reorganization of the brain network during motor imagery tasks when subject to visual stimulation or visual-electrotactile stimulation feedback. This study can provide healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the changes in the brain network and help develop successful treatment approaches for brain-computer interface-based motor rehabilitation applications. We examine individual edges, nodes, and the entire network, and use the minimum spanning tree algorithm to construct a brain network representation using a functional connectivity matrix. Furthermore, graph analysis is used to detect significant features in the brain network that might arise in response to the feedback. Additionally, we investigate the power distribution of brain activation patterns using power spectral analysis and evaluate the motor imagery performance based on the classification accuracy. The results showed that the visual and visual-electrotactile stimulation feedback induced subject-specific changes in brain activation patterns and network reorganization in the [Formula: see text] band.

In this work we evaluate the combination of these methods in a multiclass classification problem, comparing them with a conventional method in order to determine if their performance is regular. For comparison with SRC we use multilayer perceptron (MLP). We also evaluated a hybrid approach for classification of sparse representations with MLP (RSMLP). For comparison with EMD we used filtering by frequency bands. Feature selection methods were used to select the most significant ones, specifically Random Forest and Particle Swarm Optimization. Finally, we used data augmentation to get a more voluminous base. Regarding the first dataset, we observed that the classifiers that use sparse representation have results equivalent to each other, but they outperform the conventional MLP model. SRC and SRMLP achieve an average accuracy of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively while the MLP is [Formula: see text], representing a gain between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text].

To examine this question, we conducted an investigation using EEG in combination with noninvasive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during index finger abduction (ABD) and power grip imaginations. The TMS was administered employing diverse coil orientations to selectively stimulate corticospinal axons, aiming to target both early and late synaptic inputs to corticospinal neurons. TMS was triggered based on the alpha power levels, categorized in 20th percentile bins, derived from the individual alpha power distribution during the imagined tasks of ABD and power grip. Our analysis revealed negative correlations between alpha power and motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, as well as positive correlations with MEP latency across all coil orientations for each imagined task. Furthermore, we conducted functional network analysis in the alpha band to explore network connectivity during imagined index finger abduction and power grip tasks. Our findings indicate that network connections were denser in the fronto-parietal area during imagined ABD compared to power grip conditions. Moreover, the functional network properties demonstrated potential for effectively classifying between these two imagined tasks. These results provide functional evidence supporting the hypothesis that alpha oscillations may play a role in suppressing MEP amplitude and latency during imagined power grip. We propose that imagined ABD and power grip tasks may activate different populations and densities of axons at the cortical level.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37729574/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37729574/,English,Include,,Cortical Contributions to Imagined Power Grip Task: An EEG-Triggered TMS Study.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

The high-performance decoding capability of MI-EEG signals is a key issue that impacts the development of the industry. However, decoding MI-EEG signals is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and inter-subject variability. In response to the aforementioned core problems, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end network, a fusion multi-branch 1D convolutional neural network (EEG-FMCNN), to decode MI-EEG signals without pre-processing. The utilization of multi-branch 1D convolution not only exhibits a certain level of noise tolerance but also addresses the issue of inter-subject variability to some extent. This is attributed to the ability of multi-branch architectures to capture information from different frequency bands, enabling the establishment of optimal convolutional scales and depths. Furthermore, we incorporate 1D squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks and shortcut connections at appropriate locations to further enhance the generalization and robustness of the network.

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a communication system that allows humans to communicate with their environment by detecting and quantifying control signals produced from different modalities and translating them into voluntary commands for actuating an external device. For that purpose, classification the brain signals with a very high accuracy and minimization of the errors is of profound importance to the researchers.

The proposed framework is tested on BCI Competition IV dataset 1 and BCI Competition III dataset 4a. Artifact removal from EEG data is done through preprocessing, followed by feature extraction for recognizing discriminative information in the recorded brain signals. Signal preprocessing involves the application of independent component analysis (ICA) on raw EEG data, accompanied by the employment of common spatial pattern (CSP) and log-variance for extracting useful features. Six different classification algorithms, namely support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, decision trees, and logistic regression, have been compared to classify the EEG data accurately.

Average classification accuracy of 90.42% has been attained on BCI Competition IV dataset 1 for seven different subjects, while for BCI Competition III dataset 4a, an average accuracy of 95.42% has been attained on five subjects.

In the initial stage, we designed a technique that combines the synthetic minority oversampling with the edited nearest neighbor rule for data augmentation to construct more discriminative initial classifiers. When used online, the incoming chunk of data is first pseudo-labeled by RWOS-ELM as well as an auxiliary classifier, and then balanced again by the above-mentioned technique. Initial classifiers are further updated based on these class-balanced data. Offline experimental results on two publicly available MI datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme over its counterparts.

We put forward a general experimental framework based on the rapid switching between psychiatric symptom states. This enable neurophysiological measures to be derived from EEG and/or TMS-evoked EEG measures of brain activity during both states. By subtracting the data recorded during the baseline state from that recorded during the provoked state, the resulting contrast would ideally isolate the specific neural circuits differentially activated during the expression of symptoms. A similar approach enables the design of effective classifiers of brain activity from EEG data in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI). To obtain reliable contrast data, psychiatric state switching needs to be achieved multiple times during a continuous recording so that slow changes of brain activity affect both conditions equally. This is achieved easily for conditions that can be controlled intentionally, such as motor imagery, attention, or memory retention. With regard to psychiatric symptoms, an increase can often be provoked effectively relatively easily, however, it can be difficult to reliably and rapidly return to a baseline state. Here, we review different approaches to return from a provoked state to a baseline state and how these may be applied to different symptoms occurring in different psychiatric disorders.",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37671039/,English,Exclude,Review/survey papers,Toward personalized circuit-based closed-loop brain-interventions in psychiatry: using symptom provocation to extract EEG-markers of brain circuit activity.,,,,,0.95,0.6,

In any automatic ER, machine learning (ML) models classify emotions using the extracted features from the EEG signals, and therefore, such feature extraction is a crucial part of ER process. Recently, EEG channel connectivity features have been widely used in ER, where Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), mutual information (MI), phase-locking value (PLV), and transfer entropy (TE) are well-known methods for connectivity feature map (CFM) construction. CFMs are typically formed in a two-dimensional configuration using the signals from two EEG channels, and such two-dimensional CFMs are usually symmetric and hold redundant information.

Specifically, the proposed innovative technique intelligently combines CFMs' measures of two different individual methods, and its outcomes are more informative as a fused CFM.

This paper proposes a novel motion-assisted method based on a novel dual-branch multiscale auto encoder network (MSAENet) to decode human brain motion imagery intentions, while introducing a central loss function to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional classifiers that only consider inter-class differences and ignore intra-class coupling. The effectiveness of the method is validated on three datasets, namely BCIIV2a, SMR-BCI and OpenBMI, to achieve zero calibration of the MI-BCI system. The results show that our proposed network displays good results on all three datasets. In the case of subject-independence, the MSAENet outperformed the other four comparison methods on the BCIIV2a and SMR-BCI datasets, while achieving F1_score values as high as 69.34% on the OpenBMI dataset. Our method maintains better classification accuracy with a small number of parameters and short prediction times, and the method achieves zero calibration of the MI-BCI system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37509039/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37509039/,English,Include,,Subject-Independent EEG Classification of Motor Imagery Based on Dual-Branch Feature Fusion.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Notably, end-to-end EEG decoding has gained widespread popularity in recent years owing to the remarkable advances in deep learning research. However, many EEG studies suffer from limited sample sizes, making it difficult for existing deep learning models to effectively generalize to highly noisy EEG data. To address this fundamental limitation, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end EEG decoding algorithm that utilizes a low-rank weight matrix to encode both spatio-temporal filters and the classifier, all optimized under a principled sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. Importantly, this SBL framework also enables us to learn hyperparameters that optimally penalize the model in a Bayesian fashion. The proposed decoding algorithm is systematically benchmarked on five motor imagery BCI EEG datasets ( N=192) and an emotion recognition EEG dataset ( N=45), in comparison with several contemporary algorithms, including end-to-end deep-learning-based EEG decoding algorithms. The classification results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms the competing algorithms while yielding neurophysiologically meaningful spatio-temporal patterns.

The common spatial patterns algorithm is the most popular spatial filtering technique for collecting EEG signal features in MI-based BCI systems. Due to the defect that it only considers the spatial information of EEG signals and is susceptible to noise interference and other issues, its performance is diminished. In this study, we developed a Riemannian transform feature extraction method based on filter bank fusion with a combination of multiple time windows. First, we proposed the multi-time window data segmentation and recombination method by combining it with a filter group to create new data samples. This approach could capture individual differences due to the variation in time-frequency patterns across different participants, thereby improving the model's generalization performance. Second, Riemannian geometry was used for feature extraction from non-Euclidean structured EEG data. Then, considering the non-Gaussian distribution of EEG signals, the neighborhood component analysis (NCA) algorithm was chosen for feature selection. Finally, to meet real-time requirements and a low complexity, we employed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classification algorithm. The proposed model achieved improved accuracy and robustness.

However, the position and duration of the discriminative segment in an EEG trial vary from subject to subject and even trial to trial, and this leads to poor performance of subject-independent motor imagery classification. Thus, determining how to detect and utilize the discriminative signal segments is crucial for improving the performance of subject-independent motor imagery BCI. In this paper, a shallow mirror transformer is proposed for subject-independent motor imagery EEG classification. Specifically, a multihead self-attention layer with a global receptive field is employed to detect and utilize the discriminative segment from the entire input EEG trial. Furthermore, the mirror EEG signal and the mirror network structure are constructed to improve the classification precision based on ensemble learning. Finally, the subject-independent setup was used to evaluate the shallow mirror transformer on motor imagery EEG signals from subjects existing in the training set and new subjects.

However, most studies fail to fully explore temporal dependencies among MI-related patterns generated in different stages during MI tasks, resulting in limited MI-EEG decoding performance. Apart from feature extraction, learning temporal dependencies is equally important to develop a subject-specific MI-based BCI because every subject has their own way of performing MI tasks. In this paper, a novel temporal dependency learning convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention mechanism is proposed to address MI-EEG decoding. The network first learns spatial and spectral information from multi-view EEG data via the spatial convolution block. Then, a series of non-overlapped time windows is employed to segment the output data, and the discriminative feature is further extracted from each time window to capture MI-related patterns generated in different stages. Furthermore, to explore temporal dependencies among discriminative features in different time windows, we design a temporal attention module that assigns different weights to features in various time windows and fuses them into more discriminative features.

Recurrent neural network (RNN)-based learning strategy has been widely utilized to differentiate brain states, because its optimization architectures improve the classification performance for differentiating brain states at the group level. However, present classification performance is still far from satisfactory. We have identified two major focal points for improvements: one is about organizing the input EEG signals, and the other is related to the design of the RNN architecture. To optimize the above-mentioned issues and achieve better brain state classification performance, we propose a novel multi-clip random fragment strategy-based interactive bidirectional recurrent neural network (McRFS-IBiRNN) model in this work. This model has two advantages over previous methods. First, the McRFS component is designed to re-organize the input EEG signals to make them more suitable for the RNN architecture. Second, the IBiRNN component is an innovative design to model the RNN layers with interaction connections to enhance the fusion of bidirectional features. By adopting the proposed model, promising brain states classification performances are obtained. For example, 96.97% and 99.34% of individual and group level four-category classification accuracies are successfully obtained on the EEG motor/imagery dataset, respectively. A 99.01% accuracy can be observed for four-category classification tasks with new subjects not seen before, which demonstrates the generalization of our proposed method.

However, in real applications, traditional Granger causality is prone to the influence of outliers, such as inevitable ocular artifacts, resulting in unreasonable brain linkages and the failure to decipher inherent cognition states. In this work, motivated by constructing the sparse causality brain networks under the strong physiological outlier noise conditions, we proposed a dual Laplacian Granger causality analysis (DLap-GCA) by imposing Laplacian distributions on both model parameters and residuals. In essence, the first Laplacian assumption on residuals will resist the influence of outliers in electroencephalogram (EEG) on causality inference, and the second Laplacian assumption on model parameters will sparsely characterize the intrinsic interactions among multiple brain regions. Through simulation study, we quantitatively verified its effectiveness in suppressing the influence of complex outliers, the stable capacity for model estimation, and sparse network inference. The application to motor-imagery (MI) EEG further reveals that our method can effectively capture the inherent hemispheric lateralization of MI tasks with sparse patterns even under strong noise conditions. The MI classification based on the network features derived from the proposed approach shows higher accuracy than other existing traditional approaches, which is attributed to the discriminative network structures being captured in a timely manner by DLap-GCA even under the single-trial online condition.

However, EEG signals vary from subject to subject. Based on Transformer, how to effectively use data from other subjects (source domain) to improve the classification performance of a single subject (target domain) remains a challenge. To fill this gap, we propose a novel architecture called MI-CAT. The architecture innovatively utilizes Transformer's self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to interact features to resolve differential distribution between different domains. Specifically, we adopt a patch embedding layer for the extracted source and target features to divide the features into multiple patches. Then, we comprehensively focus on the intra-domain and inter-domain features by stacked multiple Cross-Transformer Blocks (CTBs), which can adaptively conduct bidirectional knowledge transfer and information exchange between domains. Furthermore, we also utilize two non-shared domain-based attention blocks to efficiently capture domain-dependent information, optimizing the features extracted from the source and target domains to assist in feature alignment. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on two real public EEG datasets, Dataset IIb and Dataset IIa, achieving competitive performance with an average classification accuracy of 85.26% and 76.81%, respectively.

The experimental results demonstrate that LMDA-Net outperforms other representative methods in terms of classification accuracy and predicting volatility, achieving the highest accuracy in all datasets within 300 training epochs. Ablation experiments further confirm the effectiveness of the channel attention module and the depth attention module. To facilitate an in-depth understanding of the features extracted by LMDA-Net, we propose class-specific neural network feature interpretability algorithms that are suitable for evoked responses and endogenous activities. By mapping the output of the specific layer of LMDA-Net to the time or spatial domain through class activation maps, the resulting feature visualizations can provide interpretable analysis and establish connections with EEG time-spatial analysis in neuroscience.

EEG and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals were simultaneously recorded before and after this transient NFT. Cortical activation was significantly improved after repeated and continuous NFT through time-frequency and topological analysis. A classifier calibration strategy, weighted EEG-fNIRS patterns (WENP), was proposed, in which elementary classifiers were constructed by using both the EEG and fNIRS information and then integrated into a strong classifier with their independent accuracy-based weight assessment.

As the number of BCI acquisition channels increases, more EEG information can be gathered. However, having too many channels will reduce the practicability of the BCI system, raise the likelihood of poor-quality channels, and lead to information misinterpretation. These issues pose challenges to the advancement of BCI systems. Determining the optimal configuration of BCI acquisition channels can minimize the number of channels utilized, but it is challenging to maintain the original operating system and accommodate individual variations in channel layout. To address these concerns, this study introduces the EEG-completion-informer (EC-informer), which is based on the Informer architecture known for its effectiveness in time-series problems. By providing input from four BCI acquisition channels, the EC-informer can generate several virtual acquisition channels to extract additional EEG information for analysis. This approach allows for the direct inheritance of the original model, significantly reducing researchers' workload. Moreover, EC-informers demonstrate strong performance in damaged channel repair and poor channel identification. Using the Informer as a foundation, the study proposes the EC-informer, tailored to BCI requirements and demanding only a small number of training samples. This approach eliminates the need for extensive computing units to train an efficient, lightweight model while preserving comprehensive information about target channels. The study also confirms that the proposed model can be transferred to other operators with minimal loss, exhibiting robust applicability.

Researchers have found that brain-computer interface (BCI) techniques can result in better stroke patient rehabilitation. This study used the proposed motor imagery (MI) framework to analyze the electroencephalogram (EEG) dataset from eight subjects in order to enhance the MI-based BCI systems for stroke patients. The preprocessing portion of the framework comprises the use of conventional filters and the independent component analysis (ICA) denoising approach. Fractal dimension (FD) and Hurst exponent (Hur) were then calculated as complexity features, and Tsallis entropy (TsEn) and dispersion entropy (DispEn) were assessed as irregularity parameters. The MI-based BCI features were then statistically retrieved from each participant using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to demonstrate the individuals' performances from four classes (left hand, right hand, foot, and tongue). The dimensionality reduction algorithm, Laplacian Eigenmap (LE), was used to enhance the MI-based BCI classification performance. Utilizing k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) classifiers, the groups of post-stroke patients were ultimately determined. The findings show that LE with RF and KNN obtained 74.48% and 73.20% accuracy, respectively; therefore, the integrated set of the proposed features along with ICA denoising technique can exactly describe the proposed MI framework, which may be used to explore the four classes of MI-based BCI rehabilitation.

To date, the application of deep-learning techniques in independent portable brain-computer-interface (BCI) devices has not been extensively explored. In this study, we proposed a high-accuracy MI EEG decoder by incorporating spatial-attention mechanism into convolution neural network (CNN), and deployed it on fully integrated single-chip microcontroller unit (MCU).

However, when EEG data is taken as input in raw time series, traditional 1D-CNNs are unable to acquire both frequency domain and channel association information. To solve this problem, this study proposes a novel algorithm by inserting two modules into CNN.

However, to the best of our knowledge, these studies have yet to investigate and evaluate the datasets, although data quality is essential for reliable results and the design of subject- or system-independent BCIs. In this study, we conducted a thorough investigation of motor imagery/execution EEG datasets recorded from healthy participants published over the past 13 years. The 25 datasets were collected from six repositories and subjected to a meta-analysis. In particular, we reviewed the specifications of the recording settings and experimental design, and evaluated the data quality measured by classification accuracy from standard algorithms such as Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for comparison and compatibility across the datasets. As a result, we found that various stimulation types, such as text, figure, or arrow, were used to instruct subjects what to imagine and the length of each trial also differed, ranging from 2.5 to 29 s with a mean of 9.8 s. Typically, each trial consisted of multiple sections: pre-rest (2.38 s), imagination ready (1.64 s), imagination (4.26 s, ranging from 1 to 10 s), the post-rest (3.38 s).

Inevitably, the sensory electrodes on the entire scalp would collect signals irrelevant to the particular BCI task, increasing the risks of overfitting in machine learning-based predictions. While this issue is being addressed by scaling up the EEG datasets and handcrafting the complex predictive models, this also leads to increased computation costs. Moreover, the model trained for one set of subjects cannot easily be adapted to other sets due to inter-subject variability, which creates even higher over-fitting risks. Meanwhile, despite previous studies using either convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) to determine spatial correlations between brain regions, they fail to capture brain functional connectivity beyond physical proximity. To this end, we propose 1) removing task-irrelevant noises instead of merely complicating models; 2) extracting subject-invariant discriminative EEG encodings, by taking functional connectivity into account. Specifically, we construct a task-adaptive graph representation of the brain network based on topological functional connectivity rather than distance-based connections. Further, non-contributory EEG channels are excluded by selecting only functional regions relevant to the corresponding intention. We empirically show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art, with around 1% and 11% improvements over CNN-based and GNN-based models, on performing motor imagery predictions.

The performance of most electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models depends on the characteristics of specific subjects and periods, which require calibration and training with annotated data prior to application. However, this situation will become unacceptable as it would be difficult for subjects to collect data for an extended period, especially in the rehabilitation process of disability based on motor imagery (MI). To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework called iterative self-training multisubject domain adaptation (ISMDA) that focuses on the offline MI task. First, the feature extractor is purposefully designed to map the EEG to a latent space of discriminative representations. Second, the attention module based on dynamic transfer matches the source domain and target domain samples with a higher coincidence degree in latent space. Then, an independent classifier oriented to the target domain is employed in the first stage of the iterative training process to cluster the samples of the target domain through similarity. Finally, a pseudolabel algorithm based on certainty and confidence is employed in the second stage of the iterative training process to adequately calibrate the error between prediction and empirical probabilities.

Inspired by the concept of cross-frequency coupling and its correlation with different behavioral tasks, this paper proposes a lightweight Interactive Frequency Convolutional Neural Network (IFNet) to explore cross-frequency interactions for enhancing representation of MI characteristics. IFNet first extracts spectro-spatial features in low and high-frequency bands, respectively. Then the interplay between the two bands is learned using an element-wise addition operation followed by temporal average pooling. Combined with repeated trial augmentation as a regularizer, IFNet yields spectro-spatio-temporally robust features for the final MI classification. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: the BCI competition IV 2a (BCIC-IV-2a) dataset and the OpenBMI dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art MI decoding algorithms, IFNet achieves significantly superior classification performance on both datasets while improving the winner's result in BCIC-IV-2a by 11%. Moreover, by conducting sensitivity analysis on decision windows, we show IFNet attains the best trade-off between decoding speed and accuracy. Detailed analysis and visualization verify IFNet can capture the coupling across frequency bands along with the known MI signatures. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IFNet for MI decoding.

A multi-way extension of AE-FBCSP is also introduced in this paper. Features are extracted from high-density EEG (64 electrodes), by means of FBCSP, and used to train a custom AE, in an unsupervised way, to project the features into a compressed latent space.

Advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have facilitated the detection of MI from electroencephalogram (EEG). Previous studies have proposed various EEG-based classification algorithms to identify the MI, however, the performance of prior models was limited due to the cross-subject heterogeneity in EEG data and the shortage of EEG data for training. Therefore, inspired by generative adversarial network (GAN), this study aims to propose an improved domain adaption network based on Wasserstein distance, which utilizes existing labeled data from multiple subjects (source domain) to improve the performance of MI classification on a single subject (target domain). Specifically, our proposed framework consists of three components, including a feature extractor, a domain discriminator, and a classifier. The feature extractor employs an attention mechanism and a variance layer to improve the discrimination of features extracted from different MI classes. Next, the domain discriminator adopts the Wasserstein matrix to measure the distance between source domain and target domain, and aligns the data distributions of source and target domain via adversarial learning strategy. Finally, the classifier uses the knowledge acquired from the source domain to predict the labels in the target domain. The proposed EEG-based MI classification framework was evaluated by two open-source datasets, the BCI Competition IV Datasets 2a and 2b.

We first modeled the deep features of EEG signals as a decomposition of subject-invariant and subject-variant features corrupted by anatomical/physiological characteristics. Subject-variant features were then removed from the deep features by learning the network with a baseline correction module (BCM) using the underlying individual information in baseline-EEG signals. The subject-invariant loss forces the BCM to assemble subject-invariant features that have the same class, irrespective of the subject. Using 1-min baseline-EEG signals of the new subject, our algorithm can eliminate subject-variant components from test data without the calibration process.

Due to being portable, non-invasive, and safe, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is preferred for developing BCIs. Previous BCIs based on fNIRS mainly relied on activation information, which ignored the functional connectivity between neural areas. In this study, a 4-class speech imagery BCI based on fNIRS is presented to decode simplified articulation motor imagery (only the movements of jaw and lip were retained) of different vowels. Synchronization information in the motor cortex was extracted as features. In multiclass (four classes) settings, the mean subject-dependent classification accuracies approximated or exceeded 40% in the 0-2.5 s and 0-10 s time windows, respectively. In binary class settings (the average classification accuracies of all pairwise comparisons between two vowels), the mean subject-dependent classification accuracies exceeded 70% in the 0-2.5 s and 0-10 s time windows. These results demonstrate that connectivity features can effectively differentiate different vowels even if the time window size was reduced from 10 s to 2.5 s and the decoding performance in both the time windows was almost the same. This finding suggests that speech imagery BCI based on fNIRS can be further optimized in terms of feature extraction and command generation time reduction.

However, the accuracy of MVAR parameter estimation is considerably affected by outliers such as head movements and eye blinks contained in EEG signals, especially in short time windows. We proposed a robust MVAR parameter estimation method based on a Bayesian probabilistic framework and Laplace fitting error known as Lap-SBL. With the Bayesian inference framework, we can accurately estimate the MVAR parameters under short time windows. Additionally, to alleviate the influence of outliers, we model the fitting error using the Laplace distribution instead of the typical Gaussian distribution. We employ convex analysis to model the inference task by approximating the Laplace noise prior with a maximum over Gaussian functions with varying scales. The variational inference approach was used to efficiently estimate the MVAR parameters. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method obtains less parameter estimation bias and more consistent linkages than existing benchmark methods, i.e., LS, LASSO, LAPPS and SBL. The motor imagery experimental data analysis shows that Lap-SBL can better describe the lateralization characteristics of brain network.

Brain computer interface (BCI) is the best hope for many individuals with motor deficiencies. It will help many patients interact with the outside world and handle their daily tasks without assistance. Therefore, machine learning-based BCI systems have emerged as non-invasive techniques for reading out signals from the brain and interpreting them into commands to help those people to perform diverse limb motor tasks. This paper proposes an innovative and improved machine learning-based BCI system that analyzes EEG signals obtained from motor imagery to distinguish among various limb motor tasks based on BCI competition III dataset IVa. The proposed framework pipeline for EEG signal processing performs the following major steps. The first step uses a meta-heuristic optimization technique, called the whale optimization algorithm (WOA), to select the optimal features for discriminating between neural activity patterns. The pipeline then uses machine learning models such as LDA, k-NN, DT, RF, and LR to analyze the chosen features to enhance the precision of EEG signal analysis. The proposed BCI system, which merges the WOA as a feature selection method and the optimized k-NN classification model, demonstrated an overall accuracy of 98.6%, outperforming other machine learning models and previous techniques on the BCI competition III dataset IVa. Additionally, the EEG feature contribution in the ML classification model is reported using Explainable AI (XAI) tools, which provide insights into the individual contributions of the features in the predictions made by the model. By incorporating XAI techniques, the results of this study offer greater transparency and understanding of the relationship between the EEG features and the model's predictions.

We analyzed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 18 individuals completing cued motor imagery, mental arithmetic, and silent word generation tasks. Participants imagined movements of both hands (HANDS) and both feet (FEET), subtracted two numbers (SUB), and silently generated words (WORD). The task-related cortical engagement was inferred from beta band (17-25 Hz) power decrements estimated using a frequency-resolved beamforming method. In the hands and feet motor imagery tasks, beta power consistently decreased in premotor and motor areas. In the word and subtraction tasks, beta-power decrements showed engagements in language and arithmetic processing within the temporal, parietal, and inferior frontal regions. A support vector machine classification of beta power decrements yielded high accuracy rates of 74 and 68% for classifying motor-imagery (HANDS vs. FEET) and cognitive (WORD vs. SUB) tasks, respectively. From the motor-versus-nonmotor contrasts, excellent accuracy rates of 85 and 80% were observed for hands-versus-word and hands-versus-sub, respectively. A multivariate Gaussian-process classifier provided an accuracy rate of 60% for the four-way (HANDS-FEET-WORD-SUB) classification problem. Individual task performance was revealed by within-subject correlations of beta-decrements.

It is difficult to apply these paradigms to the dynamic force interaction process between the robot and the patient in a brain-controlled rehabilitation robot system, which needs to induce thinking states of the patient's demand for assistance. Therefore, in our research, according to the movement of wiping the table in human daily life, we designed a three-level-force MI paradigm under a unilateral upper-limb dynamic state. Based on the event-related de-synchronization (ERD) feature analysis of the electroencephalography (EEG) signals generated by the brain's force change motor imagination, we proposed a multi-scale temporal convolutional network with attention mechanism (MSTCN-AM) algorithm to recognize ERD features of MI-EEG signals. Aiming at the slight feature differences of single-trial MI-EEG signals among different levels of force, the MSTCN module was designed to extract fine-grained features of different dimensions in the time-frequency domain. The spatial convolution module was then used to learn the area differences of space domain features. Finally, the attention mechanism dynamically weighted the time-frequency-space domain features to improve the algorithm's sensitivity.

In particular, KCS-FCnet uses a single 1D-convolutional-based neural network to extract temporal-frequency features from raw EEG data and a cross-spectral Gaussian kernel connectivity layer to model channel functional relationships. As a result, the functional connectivity feature map reduces the number of parameters, improving interpretability by extracting meaningful patterns related to MI tasks.

Moreover, visually guided motor imagery was introduced to improve the rehabilitation impact. However, the reported results to support these techniques remain unsatisfactory. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can be represented by a sequence of a limited number of topographies (microstates). To explore the dynamic brain activation patterns, we conducted EEG microstate and microstate-specific functional connectivity analyses on EEG data under motor imagery (MI), motor execution (ME), and guided MI (GMI) conditions. By comparing sixteen microstate parameters, the brain activation patterns induced by GMI show more similarities to ME than MI from a microstate perspective. The mean duration and duration of microstate four are proposed as biomarkers to evaluate motor condition. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained with microstate parameters achieved average accuracies of 80.27% and 66.30% for ME versus MI and GMI classification, respectively. Further, functional connectivity patterns showed a strong relationship with microstates. Key node analysis shows clear switching of key node distribution between brain areas among different microstates. The neural mechanism of the switching pattern is discussed. While microstate analysis indicates similar brain dynamics between GMI and ME, graph theory-based microstate-specific functional connectivity analysis implies that visual guidance may reduce the functional integration of the brain network during MI. Thus, we proposed that combined MI and GMI for BCI can improve neurorehabilitation effects.

Measured signals, especially EEG motor imagery signals, are often inconsistent or distorted, which compromises their classification accuracy. Achieving a reliable classification of motor imagery EEG signals opens the door to possibilities such as the assessment of consciousness, brain computer interfaces or diagnostic tools. We seek a method that works with a reduced number of variables, in order to avoid overfitting and to improve interpretability. This work aims to enhance EEG signal classification accuracy by using methods based on time series analysis. Previous work on this line, usually took a univariate approach, thus losing the possibility to take advantage of the correlation information existing within the time series provided by the different electrodes. To overcome this problem, we propose a multivariate approach that can fully capture the relationships among the different time series included in the EEG data. To perform the multivariate time series analysis, we use a multi-resolution analysis approach based on the discrete wavelet transform, together with a stepwise discriminant that selects the most discriminant variables provided by the discrete wavelet transform analysis RESULTS: Applying this methodology to EEG data to differentiate between the motor imagery tasks of moving either hands or feet has yielded very good classification results, achieving in some cases up to 100% of accuracy for this 2-class pre-processed dataset. Besides, the fact that these results were achieved using a reduced number of variables (55 out of 22,176) can shed light on the relevance and impact of those variables. This work has a potentially large impact, as it enables classification of EEG data based on multivariate time series analysis in an interpretable way with high accuracy. The method allows a model with a reduced number of features, facilitating its interpretability and improving overfitting. Future work will extend the application of this classification method to help in diagnosis procedures for detecting brain pathologies and for its use in brain computer interfaces.

Currently, the most promising approach for implementing the MI paradigm is the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), which uses Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors to detect brain activity. However, MI-BCI control depends on a synergy between user skills and EEG signal analysis. Thus, decoding brain neural responses recorded by scalp electrodes poses still challenging due to substantial limitations, such as non-stationarity and poor spatial resolution. Also, an estimated third of people need more skills to accurately perform MI tasks, leading to underperforming MI-BCI systems. As a strategy to deal with BCI-Inefficiency, this study identifies subjects with poor motor performance at the early stages of BCI training by assessing and interpreting the neural responses elicited by MI across the evaluated subject set. Using connectivity features extracted from class activation maps, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network-based framework for learning relevant information from high-dimensional dynamical data to distinguish between MI tasks while preserving the post-hoc interpretability of neural responses. Two approaches deal with inter/intra-subject variability of MI EEG data: (a) Extracting functional connectivity from spatiotemporal class activation maps through a novel kernel-based cross-spectral distribution estimator, (b) Clustering the subjects according to their achieved classifier accuracy, aiming to find common and discriminative patterns of motor skills.

Although many transfer learning methods can compensate for the inter- and intra-subject variability to some extent, there is still a lack of clear understanding about the change of feature distribution between the cross-subject and cross-session electroencephalography (EEG) signal.

The EEG signal from both the multi-subject (Exp1) and multi-session (Exp2) experiments has been analyzed from multiple perspectives. Firstly we found that with the similar variability of classification results, the time-frequency response of the EEG signal within-subject in Exp2 is more consistent than cross-subject results in Exp1. Secondly, the standard deviation of the common spatial pattern (CSP) feature has a significant difference between Exp1 and Exp2. Thirdly, for model training, different strategies for the training sample selection should be applied for the cross-subject and cross-session tasks.

These allow BCI to be used and pave the way for pro-active health management and the development of internet-of-medical-things architecture. However, EEG-based BCIs have low fidelity, high variance, and EEG signals are very noisy. These challenges compel researchers to design algorithms that can process big data in real-time while being robust to temporal variations and other variations in the data. Another issue in designing a passive BCI is the regular change in user's cognitive state (measured through cognitive workload). Though considerable amount of research has been conducted on this front, methods that could withstand high variability in EEG data and still reflect the neuronal dynamics of cognitive state variations are lacking and much needed in literature. In this research, we evaluate the efficacy of a combination of functional connectivity algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for the classification of three different levels of cognitive workload. We acquire 64-channel EEG data from 23 participants executing the n-back task at three different levels; 1-back (low-workload condition), 2-back (medium-workload condition), and 3-back (high-workload condition). We compared two different functional connectivity algorithms, namely phase transfer entropy (PTE) and mutual information (MI). PTE is a directed functional connectivity algorithm, whereas MI is non-directed. Both methods are suitable for extracting functional connectivity matrices in real-time, which could eventually be used for rapid, robust, and efficient classification.

Results reveal a classification accuracy of 92.81% with MI and BrainNetCNN and a staggering 99.50% with PTE and BrainNetCNN on test data.

However, modeling and classification of MI EEG signals remains a challenging task due to the non-linear and non-stationary characteristics of the signals. In this paper, a new time-varying modeling framework combining multiwavelet basis functions and regularized orthogonal forward regression (ROFR) algorithm is proposed for the characterization and classification of MI EEG signals. Firstly, the time-varying coefficients of the time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model are precisely approximated with the multiwavelet basis functions. Then a powerful ROFR algorithm is employed to dramatically alleviate the redundant model structure and accurately recover the relevant time-varying model parameters to obtain high resolution power spectral density (PSD) features. Finally, the features are sent to different classifiers for the classification task. To effectively improve the accuracy of classification, a principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm is utilized to determine the best feature subset and Bayesian optimization algorithm is performed to obtain the optimal parameters of the classifier. The proposed method achieves satisfactory classification accuracy on the public BCI Competition II Dataset III, which proves that this method potentially improves the recognition accuracy of MI EEG signals, and has great significance for the construction of BCI system based on MI.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36842221/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36842221/,English,Include,,A multiwavelet-based sparse time-varying autoregressive modeling for motor imagery EEG classification.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Many different signal processing methods, machine learning and deep learning models have been developed for the classification of motor imagery signals. Among these, Convolutional Neural Network models generally achieve better results than other models. Because the size and shape of the data is important for training Convolutional Neural Network models and discovering the right relationships, researchers have designed and experimented with many different input shape structures. However, no study has been found in the literature evaluating the effect of different input shapes on model performance and accuracy. In this study, the effects of different input shapes on model performance and accuracy in the classification of EEG motor imagery signals were investigated, which had not been specifically studied before. In addition, signal preprocessing methods, which take a long time before classification, were not used; rather, two CNN models were developed for training and classification using raw data. Two different datasets, BCI Competition IV 2A and 2B, were used in classification processes. For different input shapes, 53.03-89.29% classification accuracy and 2-23 s epoch time were obtained for 2A dataset, 64.84-84.94% classification accuracy and 4-10 s epoch time were obtained for 2B dataset.

However, to well generalize classifiers to new subjects, a time-consuming calibration process is necessary due to high inter-subject variabilities of EEG signals. This process is costly and tedious, hindering the further expansion of MI-based BCIs outside of the laboratory. To reduce the calibration time of MI-based BCIs, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework that adapts multiple source subjects' labeled data to the unseen trials of target subjects. Firstly, we train one Subject Separation Network(SSN) for each of the source subjects in the dataset. Based on adversarial domain adaptation, a shared encoder is constructed to learn similar representations for both domains. Secondly, to model the factors that cause subject variabilities and eliminate the correlated noise existing in common feature space, private feature spaces orthogonal to the shared counterpart are learned for each subject. We use a shared decoder to validate that the model is actually learning from task-relevant neurophysiological information. At last, an ensemble classifier is built by the integration of the SSNs using the information extracted from each subject's task-relevant characteristics. To quantify the efficacy of the framework, we analyze the accuracy-calibration cost trade-off in MI-based BCIs, and theoretically guarantee a generalization bound on the target error. Visualizations of the transformed features illustrate the effectiveness of domain adaptation. The experimental results on the BCI Competition IV-IIa dataset prove the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared with multiple classification methods. We infer from our results that users could learn to control MI-based BCIs without a heavy calibration process.

In this study, we designed an BCI training method in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Subjects wore a head-mounted device (HMD) and executed action observation (AO) concurrently with MI (i.e., AO + MI) in VR environments.

The current state-of-the-art in BCI involves tuning classifiers to subject-specific training data, acquired over several sessions, in order to perform calibration prior to actual use of the so-called subject-specific BCI system (SS-BCI). Herein, the goal is to provide a ready-to-use system requiring minimal effort for setup. Thus, our challenge was to design a subject-independent BCI (SI-BCI) to be used by any new user without the constraint of individual calibration. Outcomes from other studies with the same purpose were used to undertake comparisons and validate our findings. For the EEG signal processing, we used a combination of the delta (0.5-4 Hz), alpha (8-13 Hz), and beta+gamma (13-40 Hz) bands at a stage prior to feature extraction. Next, we extracted features from the 27-channel EEG using common spatial pattern (CSP) and performed binary classification (MI of right- and left-hand) with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. These analyses were done for both the SS-BCI and SI-BCI models. We employed ""leave-one-subject-out"" (LOSO) arrangement and 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate our SI-BCI and SS-BCI systems, respectively. Compared with other two studies, our work was the only one that showed higher accuracy for the LDA classifier in SI-BCI as compared to SS-BCI. On the other hand, LDA accuracy was lower than accuracy achieved with SVM in both conditions (SI-BCI and SS-BCI). Our SS-BCI accuracy reached 76.85% using LDA and 94.20% using SVM and for SI-BCI we got 80.30% with LDA and 83.23% with SVM. We conclude that SI-BCI may be a feasible and relevant option, which can be used in scenarios where subjects are not able to submit themselves to long training sessions or to fast evaluation of the so called ""BCI illiteracy.""

To solve these problems, an adaptive cross-subject transfer learning algorithm is proposed, which is based on kernel mean matching (KMM) and transfer learning adaptive boosting (TrAdaBoost) method. First, the common spatial pattern (CSP) is used to extract the spatial features. Then, in order to make the feature distribution more similar among different subjects, the KMM algorithm is used to compute a sample weight matrix for aligning the mean between source and target domains and reducing distribution differences among different subjects. Finally, the sample weight matrix from KMM is used as the initialization weight of TrAdaBoost, and then TrAdaBoost is used to adaptively select source domain samples that are closer to the target task distribution to assist in building a classification model. In order to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method, the algorithm is applied to BCI Competition IV datasets and in-house datasets. The results show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed method on the public datasets is 89.1%, and the average classification accuracy on the in-house datasets is 80.4%. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method effectively improves the classification accuracy of MI-EEG signals. At the same time, this paper also applies the proposed algorithm to the in-house dataset, the results verify the effectiveness of the algorithm again, and the results of this study have certain clinical guiding significance for brain rehabilitation.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36618992/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36618992/,English,Include,,Classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram signals by using adaptive cross-subject transfer learning.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Firstly, based on the individual differences and signal characteristics in different frequency bands, an adaptive channel selection method based on expansive relevant features with label F (ReliefF) was proposed. By extracting five time-frequency domain observation features of each frequency band signal, ReliefF algorithm was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the frequency band signal in each channel, and then the corresponding signal channel was selected for each frequency band. Secondly, a feature representation method of common space pattern (CSP) based on fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) was proposed (CSP-FCBF).

However, due to the distributional disparity between EEG signals, data from other subjects cannot be used directly to train a subject-specific classifier. For efficient use of the labeled data, domain transfer learning and adversarial learning are gradually applied to BCI classification tasks. While these methods improve classification performance, they only align globally and ignore task-specific class boundaries, which may lead to the blurring of features near the classification boundaries. Simultaneously, they employ fully shared generators to extract features, resulting in the loss of domain-specific information and the destruction of performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-attention-based adversarial network for motor imagery classification (MI-DABAN). Our framework leverages multiple subjects' knowledge to improve a single subject's motor imagery classification performance by cleverly using a novel adversarial learning method and two unshared attention blocks. Specifically, without introducing additional domain discriminators, we iteratively maximize and minimize the output difference between the two classifiers to implement adversarial learning to ensure accurate domain alignment. Among them, maximization is used to identify easily confused samples near the decision boundary, and minimization is used to align the source and target domain distributions. Moreover, for the shallow features from source and target domains, we use two non-shared attention blocks to preserve domain-specific information, which can prevent the negative transfer of domain information and further improve the classification performance on test data.

As a result, proper decoding is an important step required for the interconnection of the brain and the computer. EEG decoding is a challenging process because of poor SNR, complexity, and other reasons. However, choosing an appropriate method to extract the features to improve the performance of motor imagery recognition is still a research hotspot. To extract the features of the EEG signal in the classification task, this paper proposes a Masking Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEMD) based Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (MEMD-FFBPNN). The dataset consists of EEG signals which are first normalized using the minimax method and given as input to the MEMD to extract the features and then given to the FFBPNN to classify the tasks. The accuracy of the proposed method MEMD-FFBPNN has been measured using the confusion matrix, mean square error and which has been recorded up to 99.9%. Thus, the proposed method gives better accuracy than the other conventional methods.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36405787/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36405787/,English,Include,,A comparative analysis of masking empirical mode decomposition and a neural network with feed-forward and back propagation along with masking empirical mode decomposition to improve the classification performance for a reliable brain-computer interface.,Include,,"e processing, pattern recognition, signal processing, and so on.

Increasing this number slows down the BCI operation because each stimulus has to be presented several times for better classification. Furthermore, P300 spellers typically do not utilize potentially useful imagery-based approaches, such as the motor imagery successfully practiced in motor rehabilitation. Here, we tested a P300-BCI with a motor-imagery component. In this BCI, the number of commands was increased by adding mental strategies instead of increasing the number of targets. Our BCI had only two stimuli and four commands. The subjects either counted target appearances mentally or imagined hand movements toward the targets. In this design, the motor-imagery paradigm enacted a visuomotor transformation known to engage cortical and subcortical networks participating in motor control. The operation of these networks suffers in neurological conditions such as stroke, so we view this BCI as a potential tool for the rehabilitation of patients. As an initial step toward the development of this clinical method, sixteen healthy participants were tested. Consistent with our expectation that mental strategies would result in distinct EEG activities, ERPs were different depending on whether subjects counted stimuli or imagined movements. These differences were especially clear in the late ERP components localized in the frontal and centro-parietal regions. We conclude that (1) the P300 paradigm is suitable for enacting visuomotor transformations and (2) P300-based BCIs with multiple mental strategies could be used in applications where the number of possible outputs needs to be increased while keeping the number of targets constant.

This success largely depends on the machine learning (ML) approaches like deep learning (DL) models. DL algorithms provide effective and powerful models to analyze compact and complex EEG data optimally for MI-BCI applications. DL models with CNN network have revolutionized computer vision through end-to-end learning from raw data. Meanwhile, RNN networks have been able to decode EEG signals by processing sequences of time series data. However, many challenges in the MI-BCI field have affected the performance of DL models. A major challenge is the individual differences in the EEG signal of different subjects. Therefore, the model must be retrained from the scratch for each new subject, which leads to computational costs. Analyzing the EEG signals is challenging due to its low signal to noise ratio and non-stationary nature. Additionally, limited size of existence datasets can lead to overfitting which can be prevented by using transfer learning (TF) approaches.

Electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI systems are being actively studied due to their high temporal resolution, convenient usage, and portability. However, fewer studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of high spatial resolution of EEG on decoding precise body motions, such as finger movements, which are essential in activities of daily living. Low spatial sensor resolution, as found in common EEG systems, can be improved by omitting the conventional standard of EEG electrode distribution (the international 10-20 system) and ordinary mounting structures (e.g., flexible caps). In this study, we used newly proposed flexible electrode grids attached directly to the scalp, which provided ultra-high-density EEG (uHD EEG). We explored the performance of the novel system by decoding individual finger movements using a total of 256 channels distributed over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Dense distribution and small-sized electrodes result in an inter-electrode distance of 8.6 mm (uHD EEG), while that of conventional EEG is 60 to 65 mm on average. Five healthy subjects participated in the experiment, performed single finger extensions according to a visual cue, and received avatar feedback.

However, traditional MI-BCI is rarely used for foot motor intention recognition because the motor cortex regions of both feet are anatomically close to each other, and traditional event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns for MI-BCI have insufficient spatial discrimination. This study introduced steady-state somatosensory evoked potentials (SSSEPs) by synchronous bilateral feet electrical stimulation at different frequencies, which were used as carrier signals modulated by unilateral foot motor intention. Fifteen subjects participated in MI and MI-SSSEP tasks. A Riemannian geometry classifier with a task-related component analysis (TRCA) spatial filter was proposed to demodulate the variation in SSSEP features and discriminate the left and right foot motor intentions. The feature outcomes indicated that the amplitude and phase synchronization of the SSSEPs could be well modulated by unilateral foot MI tasks under the MI-SSSEP paradigm. The classification results revealed that the modulated SSSEP features played an important role in the recognition of left-right foot discrimination. Moreover, the proposed TRCA-based method outperformed the other three methods and improved the foot average classification accuracy to 81.07± 13.29%, with the highest accuracy attained at 97.00%.

Motor-based BCIs provide an active rehabilitation scheme for post-stroke patients. However, BCI based solely on MP was rarely investigated. Since MP is the precedence phase before MI or ME, MP-BCI could potentially detect brain commands at an earlier state. This study proposes a bipedal MP-BCI system, which is actuated by the reduction in frontoparietal connectivity strength. Three substudies, including bipedal classification, neurofeedback, and post-stroke analysis, were performed to validate the performance of our proposed model. In bipedal classification, functional connectivity was extracted by Pearson's correlation model from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded while the subjects were performing MP and MI. The binary classification of MP achieved short-lived peak accuracy of 73.73(±7.99)% around 200-400 ms post-cue. The peak accuracy was found synchronized to the MP-related potential and the decrement in frontoparietal connection strength. The connection strengths of the right frontal and left parietal lobes in the alpha range were found negatively correlated to the classification accuracy. In the subjective neurofeedback study, the majority of subjects reported that motor preparation instead of the motor imagery activated the frontoparietal dysconnection. Post-stroke study also showed that patients exhibit lower frontoparietal connections compared to healthy subjects during both MP and ME phases. These findings suggest that MP reduced alpha band functional frontoparietal connectivity and the EEG signatures of left and right foot MP could be discriminated more effectively during this phase.

To tackle this problem, we consider supervised and semisupervised transfer learning. However, it is a challenge for them to cope with high intersession/subject variability in the MI electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. Based on the framework of unsupervised manifold embedded knowledge transfer (MEKT), we propose a supervised MEKT algorithm (sMEKT) and a semisupervised MEKT algorithm (ssMEKT), respectively. sMEKT only has limited labelled samples from a target subject and abundant labelled samples from multiple source subjects. Compared to sMEKT, ssMEKT adds comparably more unlabelled samples from the target subject. After performing Riemannian alignment (RA) and tangent space mapping (TSM), both sMEKT and ssMEKT execute domain adaptation to shorten the differences among subjects. During domain adaptation, to make use of the available samples, two algorithms preserve the source domain discriminability, and ssMEKT preserves the geometric structure embedded in the labelled and unlabelled target domains. Moreover, to obtain a subject-specific classifier, sMEKT minimizes the joint probability distribution shift between the labelled target and source domains, whereas ssMEKT performs the joint probability distribution shift minimization between the unlabelled target domain and all labelled domains. Experimental results on two publicly available MI datasets demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the six competing algorithms, where the sizes of labelled and unlabelled target domains are variable. Especially for the target subjects with 10 labelled samples and 270/190 unlabelled samples, ssMEKT shows 5.27% and 2.69% increase in average accuracy on the two abovementioned datasets compared to the previous best semisupervised transfer learning algorithm (RA-regularized common spatial patterns-weighted adaptation regularization, RA-RCSP-wAR), respectively.

However, they mainly focused on detecting motor imagery but did not consider the effect of false positive (FP) detection. The FP could be a threat to patients with stroke as it can induce wrong-directed brain plasticity that would result in adverse effects. In this study, we proposed a rehabilitative MI-BCI system that focuses on rejecting the FP. To this end, we first identified numerous electroencephalogram (EEG) signals as the causes of the FP, and based on the characteristics of the signals, we designed a novel two-phase classifier using a small number of EEG channels, including the source of the FP. Through experiments with eight healthy participants and nine patients with stroke, our proposed MI-BCI system showed 71.76% selectivity and 13.70% FP rate by using only four EEG channels in the patient group with stroke. Moreover, our system can compensate for day-to-day variations for prolonged session intervals by recalibration. The results suggest that our proposed system, a practical approach for the clinical setting, could improve the therapeutic effect of MI-BCI by reducing the adverse effect of the FP.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36172602/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36172602/,English,Include,,An EEG-based asynchronous MI-BCI system to reduce false positives with a small number of channels for neurorehabilitation: A pilot study.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.8,small_sample_mentioned

However, in the widely used left and right hand MI brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm, the vibration stimuli cannot be directly applied to the imaginary side due to the spontaneity of imagery. In this study, we proposed a method of phase-dependent closed-loop vibration stimulation to be applied on both hands, and explored the effects of different vibration stimuli on the left and right hand MI-BCI. Eighteen healthy subjects were recruited and asked to perform, in sequence, MI tasks under three different conditions of vibratory feedback, which were no vibration stimulus (MI), phase-dependent closed-loop vibration stimulus (PDS), and continuous vibration stimulus (CS). Then the performance of the left and right hand MI-BCI and the patterns of brain oscillation were compared and analyzed under these different stimulation conditions. The results showed that vibration stimulation effectively boosted the activation of the sensorimotor cortex and enhanced the functional connectivity among sensorimotor-related brain regions during MI. The closed-loop stimulation evoked stronger event-related desynchronization patterns on the contralateral side of the imagined hand compared to continuous stimulation. There was a more obvious distinction between left hand task and right hand task. In addition, phase-dependent closed-loop vibration stimulation increased classification accuracy by approximately 7% (paired t-test, p=0.004, n=18) compared to MI alone, while continuous vibration stimulation only increased it by 4% (paired t-test, p=0.067, n=18).

Traditional works classify EEG signals without considering the topological relationship among electrodes. However, neuroscience research has increasingly emphasized network patterns of brain dynamics. Thus, the Euclidean structure of electrodes might not adequately reflect the interaction between signals. To fill the gap, a novel deep learning (DL) framework based on the graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) is presented to enhance the decoding performance of raw EEG signals during different types of motor imagery (MI) tasks while cooperating with the functional topological relationship of electrodes. Based on the absolute Pearson's matrix of overall signals, the graph Laplacian of EEG electrodes is built up. The GCNs-Net constructed by graph convolutional layers learns the generalized features. The followed pooling layers reduce dimensionality, and the fully-connected (FC) softmax layer derives the final prediction. The introduced approach has been shown to converge for both personalized and groupwise predictions. It has achieved the highest averaged accuracy, 93.06% and 88.57% (PhysioNet dataset), 96.24% and 80.89% (high gamma dataset), at the subject and group level, respectively, compared with existing studies, which suggests adaptability and robustness to individual variability. Moreover, the performance is stably reproducible among repetitive experiments for cross-validation. The excellent performance of our method has shown that it is an important step toward better BCI approaches.

In particular, the optimal frequency band for oscillatory activity classification is highly user-dependent and many frequency band selection methods have been developed in the past two decades. However, it is not well studied whether those conventional methods can be efficiently applied to the Riemannian BCIs, a recent family of BCI systems that utilize the non-Euclidean nature of the data unlike conventional BCI pipelines. In this paper, we proposed a novel frequency band selection method working on the Riemannian manifold. The frequency band is selected considering the class distinctiveness as quantified based on the inter-class distance and the intra-class variance on the manifold. An advantage of this method is that the frequency bandwidth can be adjusted for each individual without intensive optimization steps. In a comparative experiment using a public dataset of motor imagery-based BCI, our method showed a substantial improvement in average accuracy over both a fixed broad frequency band and a popular conventional frequency band selection method. In particular, our method substantially improved performances for subjects with initially low accuracies.

In this paper, we propose a new multi-task motor imagery EEG (MI-EEG) classification framework. Unlike traditional EEG decoding algorithms, we perform the decoding task in the source domain rather than the sensor domain. In the proposed algorithm, we first build a conduction model of the signal using the public ICBM152 head model and the boundary element method (BEM). The sensor domain EEG was then mapped to the selected cortex region using standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) technology, which benefit to address volume conduction effects problem. Finally, the source domain features are extracted and classified by combining FBCSP and simple LDA. The results show that the classification-decoding algorithm performed in the source domain can well solve the classification task of MI-EEG. In addition, we found that the source imaging method can significantly increase the number of available EEG channels, which can be expanded at least double.

To address the problem of MI-BCI illiteracy, we propose a distribution adaptation method based on multi-kernel learning to make the distribution of features between the source domain and target domain become even closer to each other, while the divisibility of categories is maximized. Inspired by the kernel trick, we adopted a multiple-kernel-based extreme learning machine to train the labeled source-domain data to find a new high-dimensional subspace that maximizes data divisibility, and then use multiple-kernel-based maximum mean discrepancy to conduct distribution adaptation to eliminate the difference in feature distribution between domains in the new subspace. In light of the high dimension of features of MI-BCI illiteracy, random forest, which can effectively handle high-dimensional features without additional cross-validation, was employed as a classifier. The proposed method was validated on an open dataset.

A multi-class, multiple binary classifier framework was used to decode three kinesthetically imagined movements (motor imagery of left arm, right arm, and feet), and relaxed state. Three game paradigms were used for training i.e., NeuroSensi, Triad, and Cybathlon Race: BrainDriver. An evaluation of the pilot's performance is presented for two Cybathlon competition training periods-spanning 20 sessions over 5 weeks prior to the 2019 competition, and 25 sessions over 5 weeks in the run up to the 2020 competition. Having participated in BCI training in 2009 and competed in Cybathlon 2016, the experienced pilot achieved high two-class accuracy on all class pairs when training began in 2019 (decoding accuracy > 90%, resulting in efficient NeuroSensi and Triad game control). The BrainDriver performance (i.e., Cybathlon race completion time) improved significantly during the training period, leading up to the competition day, ranging from 274-156 s (255 ± 24 s to 191 ± 14 s mean ± std), over 17 days (10 sessions) in 2019, and from 230-168 s (214 ± 14 s to 181 ± 4 s), over 18 days (13 sessions) in 2020.

To combat this challenge, data augmentation can be performed, to enhance decoding performance. In this study, we performed data augmentation by synthesizing motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) trials, following six approaches.

We show, based on these, that the synthesized data exhibit similar characteristics with real data, gaining up to 3% and 12% increases in mean accuracies across two public datasets.

Furthermore, a multi-branch deep network (MBDN) is designed, and the maximum mean discrepancy is embedded in each branch to realign the specific feature distribution. Each branch is separately trained by an aligned source domain, and all the single branch transfer accuracies are arranged in descending order and utilized for weighted prediction of MBDN.

To overcome this limitation, a training strategy based on the combination of MI and sensory threshold somatosensory electrical stimulation (MI+st-SES) is proposed in this study. Thirty healthy subjects were recruited and randomly divided into SES group and control group. Both groups performed left-hand and right-hand MI tasks in three consecutive blocks. The main difference between two groups lies in the second block, where subjects in SES group received the st-SES during MI tasks whereas the control group performed MI tasks only. The results showed that the SES group had a significant improvement in event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha rhythm after the training session of MI+st-SES (left-hand: F(2,27) = 9.98, p<0.01; right-hand: F(2, 27) = 10.43, p<0.01).

In this paper, a fused multidimensional classification method based on extreme tree feature selection (FMCM-ETFS) is proposed for discerning motor imagery EEG tasks. First, the EEG signal was filtered by a Butterworth filter for preprocessing. Second, C3, C4, and CZ channels were selected to extract time-frequency domain and spatial domain features using autoregressive (AR), common spatial pattern (CSP), and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The extracted features were fused for a further feature elimination. Then, the features were selected using three feature selection methods: recursive feature elimination (RFE), principal component analysis method (PCA), and extreme trees (ET). The selected feature vectors were classified using support vector machines (SVM). Finally, a total of twelve subjects' EEG data from Inner Mongolia University of Technology (IMUT data), the 2nd BCI competition in 2003, and the 4th BCI competition in 2008 were employed to show the effectiveness of this proposed FMCM-ETFS method.

However, its performance is generally limited due to the small size sample problem. An alternative way to address such issue is to segment EEG trials into small slices for data augmentation, but this approach usually inevitably loses the valuable long-range dependencies of temporal information in EEG signals. To this end, we propose a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) based channel attention MLP-Mixer network (S-CAMLP-Net) for MI decoding with EEG. Specifically, a new EEG slice prediction task is designed as the pretext task to capture the long-range information of EEG trials in the time domain. In the downstream task, a newly proposed MLP-Mixer is applied to the classification task for signals rather than for images.

As of today, the classification results for EEG 4 class BCI competition dataset have been improved to provide better classification accuracy of the brain computer interface systems (BCIs). Based on this observation, a novel quick-response eigenface analysis (QR-EFA) scheme for motor imagery is proposed to improve the classification accuracy for BCIs. Thus, we considered BCI signals in standardized and sharable quick response (QR) image domain; then, we systematically combined EFA and a convolution neural network (CNN) to classify the neuro images. To overcome a non-stationary BCI dataset available and non-ergodic characteristics, we utilized an effective neuro data augmentation in the training phase. For the ultimate improvements in classification performance, QR-EFA maximizes the similarities existing in the domain-, trial-, and subject-wise directions. To validate and verify the proposed scheme, we performed an experiment on the BCI dataset. Specifically, the scheme is intended to provide a higher classification output in classification accuracy performance for the BCI competition 4 dataset 2a (C4D2a_4C) and BCI competition 3 dataset 3a (C3D3a_4C). The experimental results confirm that the newly proposed QR-EFA method outperforms the previous the published results, specifically from 85.4% to 97.87% ± 0.75 for C4D2a_4C and 88.21% ± 6.02 for C3D3a_4C.

However, existing modest performance improvement of hBCIs might be attributed to the lack of computational frameworks that exploit complementary synergistic properties in multimodal features. This study proposes a multimodal data fusion framework to represent and decode synergistic multimodal motor imagery (MI) neural responses. We hypothesize that exploiting EEG nonlinear dynamics adds a new informative dimension to the commonly combined EEG-fNIRS features and will ultimately increase the synergy between EEG and fNIRS features toward an enhanced hBCI. The EEG nonlinear dynamics were quantified by extracting graph-based recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) features to complement the commonly used spectral features for an enhanced multimodal configuration when combined with fNIRS. The high-dimensional multimodal features were further given to a feature selection algorithm relying on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for fused feature selection. Linear support vector machine (SVM) was then used to evaluate the framework. The mean hybrid classification performance improved by up to 15% and 4% compared to the unimodal EEG and fNIRS, respectively. The proposed graph-based framework substantially increased the contribution of EEG features for hBCI classification from 28.16% up to 52.9% when introduced the nonlinear dynamics and improved the performance by approximately 2%.

Traditionally, MI-BCIs operate on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which require extensive signal processing and feature engineering to extract changes in sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained popularity for EEG classification as they provide a solution for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal features in the signals. However, past BCI studies that employed DL models, only attempted them with a small group of participants, without investigating the effectiveness of this approach for different user groups such as inefficient users. BCI inefficiency is a known and unsolved problem within BCI literature, generally defined as the inability of the user to produce the desired SMR patterns for the BCI classifier. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of DL models in capturing MI features particularly in the inefficient users. EEG signals from 54 subjects who performed a MI task of left- or right-hand grasp were recorded to compare the performance of two classification approaches; a ML approach vs. a DL approach. In the ML approach, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) was used for feature extraction and then Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was employed for binary classification of the MI task. In the DL approach, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed on the raw EEG signals. Additionally, subjects were divided into high vs. low performers based on their online BCI accuracy and the difference between the two classifiers' performance was compared between groups. Our results showed that the CNN model improved the classification accuracy for all subjects within the range of 2.37 to 28.28%, but more importantly, this improvement was significantly larger for low performers.

The mainstream DL methodology for the MI-EEG classification exploits the temporospatial patterns of EEG signals using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been particularly successful in visual images. However, since the statistical characteristics of visual images depart radically from EEG signals, a natural question arises whether an alternative network architecture exists apart from CNNs. To address this question, we propose a novel geometric DL (GDL) framework called Tensor-CSPNet, which characterizes spatial covariance matrices derived from EEG signals on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and fully captures the temporospatiofrequency patterns using existing deep neural networks on SPD manifolds, integrating with experiences from many successful MI-EEG classifiers to optimize the framework.

Recording brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) is generally contaminated with both physiological and nonphysiological artifacts, which significantly hinders the BCI performance. Artifact subspace reconstruction (ASR) is a well-known statistical technique that automatically removes artifact components by determining the rejection threshold based on the initial reference EEG segment in multichannel EEG recordings. In real-world applications, the fixed threshold may limit the efficacy of the artifact correction, especially when the quality of the reference data is poor. This study proposes an adaptive online ASR technique by integrating the Hebbian/anti-Hebbian neural networks into the ASR algorithm, namely, principle subspace projection ASR (PSP-ASR) and principal subspace whitening ASR (PSW-ASR) that segmentwise self-organize the artifact subspace by updating the synaptic weights according to the Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules.

We implemented this platform in a case study of a subject with cervical spinal cord injury (C5 ASIA A). BCIs can restore independence for individuals with paralysis by using brain signals to control prosthetics or trigger functional electrical stimulation. Though several studies have successfully implemented this technology in the laboratory and the home, portability, device configuration, and caregiver setup remain challenges that limit deployment to the home environment. Portability is essential for transitioning BCI from the laboratory to the home. The BCI platform implementation consisted of an Activa PC + S generator with two subdural four-contact electrodes implanted over the dominant left hand-arm region of the sensorimotor cortex, a minicomputer fixed to the back of the subject's wheelchair, a custom mobile phone application, and a mechanical glove as the end effector. To quantify the performance for this at-home implementation of the BCI, we quantified system setup time at home, chronic (14-month) decoding accuracy, hardware and software profiling, and Bluetooth communication latency between the App and the minicomputer. We created a dataset of motor-imagery labeled signals to train a binary motor imagery classifier on a remote computer for online, at-home use. Average bluetooth data transmission delay between the minicomputer and mobile App was 23 ± 0.014 ms. The average setup time for the subject's caregiver was 5.6 ± 0.83 min. The average times to acquire and decode neural signals and to send those decoded signals to the end-effector were respectively 404.1 ms and 1.02 ms. The 14-month median accuracy of the trained motor imagery classifier was 87.5 ± 4.71% without retraining.

In most studies on hBCIs, subjects have been required to focus their attention on flickering light-emitting diodes (LEDs) or blocks while imagining body movements. However, these two classical tasks performed concurrently have a poor correlation. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce the task complexity of such a system and improve its user-friendliness.

Domain adaptation is an effective technology to remedy the shortage of target data by leveraging rich labeled data from the sources. However, most prior methods have needed to extract the features of the EEG signal first, which triggers another challenge in BCI classification, due to small sample sets or a lack of labels for the target. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptation framework, referred to as kernel-based Riemannian manifold domain adaptation (KMDA). KMDA circumvents the tedious feature extraction process by analyzing the covariance matrices of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Covariance matrices define a symmetric positive definite space (SPD) that can be described by Riemannian metrics. In KMDA, the covariance matrices are aligned in the Riemannian manifold, and then are mapped to a high dimensional space by a log-Euclidean metric Gaussian kernel, where subspace learning is performed by minimizing the conditional distribution distance between the sources and the target while preserving the target discriminative information. We also present an approach to convert the EEG trials into 2D frames (E-frames) to further lower the dimension of covariance descriptors. Experiments on three EEG datasets demonstrated that KMDA outperforms several state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in classification accuracy, with an average Kappa of 0.56 for BCI competition IV dataset IIa, 0.75 for BCI competition IV dataset IIIa, and an average accuracy of 81.56% for BCI competition III dataset IVa.

In order to develop an efficient BCI system, it is necessary to decode high-accuracy motion intention by electroencephalogram (EEG) with low signal-to-noise ratio. In this article, a MI classification approach is proposed, combining the difference in EEG signals between the left and right hemispheric electrodes with a dual convolutional neural network (dual-CNN), which effectively improved the decoding performance of BCI. The positive and inverse problems of EEG were solved by the boundary element method (BEM) and weighted minimum norm estimation (WMNE), and then the scalp signals were mapped to the cortex layer. We created nine pairs of new electrodes on the cortex as the region of interest. The time series of the nine electrodes on the left and right hemispheric are respectively used as the input of the dual-CNN model to classify four MI tasks.

The application of deep learning for EEG feature representation has been rarely investigated, nevertheless bringing improvements to the performance of motor imagery classification.

The proposed r-KLwDSA algorithm aligns the user's EEG data collected in previous sessions to the few EEG trials collected in the current session, using a novel linear alignment method. Thereafter, the aligned EEG trials from the previous sessions and the few EEG trials from the current sessions are fused through a weighting mechanism before they are used for calibrating the BCI model.

However, this raises privacy concerns, as EEG contains sensitive health and mental information. It is very important to perform privacy-preserving domain adaptation, which simultaneously improves the classification accuracy for a new user and protects the privacy of a previous user. We propose augmentation-based source-free adaptation (ASFA), which consists of two parts: 1) source model training, where a novel data augmentation approach is proposed for MI EEG signals to improve the cross-subject generalization performance of the source model; and, 2) target model training, which simultaneously considers uncertainty reduction for domain adaptation and consistency regularization for robustness. ASFA only needs access to the source model parameters, instead of the raw EEG data, thus protecting the privacy of the source domain. We further extend ASFA to a stricter privacy-preserving scenario, where the source model's parameters are also inaccessible. Experimental results on four MI datasets demonstrated that ASFA outperformed 15 classical and state-of-the-art MI classification approaches.

These measures determine the transient causal relation between different brain areas. Then a feature subset selection method based on Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to choose most significant directed causal connection between channels. Moreover, the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance feature selection method is applied to discard non-significance features. Finally, support vector machine method is used for classification.

Though several approaches have been available in the literature for learning EEG signal feature, the deep learning (DL) models need to further explore for generating novel representation of EEG features and accomplish enhanced outcomes for MI classification. With this motivation, this study designs an arithmetic optimization with RetinaNet based deep learning model for MI classification (AORNDL-MIC) technique on BCIs. The proposed AORNDL-MIC technique initially exploits Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA) approach for the EEG signal denoising and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is exploited for the transformation of 1D-EEG signal into 2D time-frequency amplitude representation, which enables to utilize the DL model via transfer learning approach. In addition, the DL based RetinaNet is applied for extracting of feature vectors from the EEG signal which are then classified with the help of ID3 classifier. In order to optimize the classification efficiency of the AORNDL-MIC technique, arithmetical optimization algorithm (AOA) is employed for hyperparameter tuning of the RetinaNet.

An experimental study is performed on two electroencephalography datasets (Iranian Brain-Computer Interface competition [iBCIC] dataset and the world BCI Competition IV dataset 2a) to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For lower complexity, the common spatial pattern is applied to decrease the 64 channel signal to four components, in addition to increase the class separability. From these components, first, some features are extracted in the time and time-frequency domains, and next, the best linear combination of these is selected by adopting the stepwise linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method, which are then applied in training and testing the classifiers including LDA, random forest, support vector machine, and K nearest neighbors. The classification strategy is of majority voting among the results of the binary classifiers.

However, due to the non-stationary nature of EEGs, a subject's signal may change over time, which poses a challenge for models that work across time. Recently, domain adaptive learning (DAL) has shown its superior performance in various classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) subspace learning algorithm with K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) as a classifier for the task of motion imagery signal classification. First, we reformulate the framework of RKHS subspace learning with a rigorous mathematical inference. Secondly, since the commonly used maximum mean difference (MMD) criterion measures the distribution variance based on the mean value only and ignores the local information of the distribution, a regularization term of source domain linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) is proposed for the first time, which reduces the variance of similar data and increases the variance of dissimilar data to optimize the distribution of source domain data. Finally, the RKHS subspace framework was constructed sparsely considering the sensitivity of the BCI data. We test the proposed algorithm in this paper, first on four standard datasets, and the experimental results show that the other baseline algorithms improve the average accuracy by 2-9% after adding SLDA.

There are such restrictions as the limited size of the existing datasets and low signal to noise ratio in the classification of MI Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Machine learning (ML) methods, particularly Deep Learning (DL), have overcome these limitations relatively. In this study, three hybrid models were proposed to classify the EEG signal in the MI-based BCI. The proposed hybrid models consist of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). In the first model, the CNN with different number of convolutional-pooling blocks (from shallow to deep CNN) was examined; a two-block CNN model not affected by the vanishing gradient descent and yet able to extract desirable features employed; the second and third models contained pre-trained CNNs conducing to the exploration of more complex features. The transfer learning strategy and data augmentation methods were applied to overcome the limited size of the datasets by transferring learning from one model to another. This was achieved by employing two powerful pre-trained convolutional neural networks namely ResNet-50 and Inception-v3. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) was used to generate images for the CNN. The performance of the proposed models was evaluated on the BCI Competition IV dataset 2a.

With reference to the total 10 channel pairs of causality differences between the two brain working states, a support vector machine is used to classify the two tasks with an overall accuracy of 83% for five-fold cross-validation. As demonstrated in the present study, fNIRS offers causality patterns in different brain states of MIBCI motor tasks. The research findings show that fNIRS causality can be used to assess different states of the brain, providing theoretical support for its application to neurorehabilitation assessment protocols to ultimately improve patients' quality of life.Video Abstract: http://links.lww.com/WNR/A653.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35139061/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35139061/,English,Include,,The brain state of motor imagery is reflected in the causal information of functional near-infrared spectroscopy.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.45,cv_reported;small_sample_mentioned

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing the calibration time of motor imagery (MI)-based BCIs without sacrificing classification accuracy. The approach aims to augment the training set size of a new subject by generating artificial electroencephalogram (EEG) data from a few training trials initially available. The artificial EEG data are obtained by first performing empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and then mixing resulting intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The original training trials are aligned to common reference point with Euclidean alignment (EA) method prior to EMD and pooled together with artificial trials as the expended training set, which is input into a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a logistic regression (LR) classifier. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on two motor imagery (MI) data sets and compared with that of the algorithm trained with only real EEG data (Baseline) and the algorithm trained with expanded EEG data by EMD without data alignment. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of training data needed to achieve a given performance level and thus is expected to facilitate the real-world applications of MI-based BCIs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35134085/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35134085/,English,Include,,Reducing calibration time in motor imagery-based BCIs by data alignment and empirical mode decomposition.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Hybrid BCI systems using electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have received significant attention for overcoming the limitations of EEG- and fNIRS-standalone BCI systems. However, most hybrid EEG-fNIRS BCI studies have focused on late fusion because of discrepancies in their temporal resolutions and recording locations. Despite the enhanced performance of hybrid BCIs, late fusion methods have difficulty in extracting correlated features in both EEG and fNIRS signals. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a deep learning-based early fusion structure, which combines two signals before the fully-connected layer, called the fNIRS-guided attention network (FGANet). First, 1D EEG and fNIRS signals were converted into 3D EEG and fNIRS tensors to spatially align EEG and fNIRS signals at the same time point. The proposed fNIRS-guided attention layer extracted a joint representation of EEG and fNIRS tensors based on neurovascular coupling, in which the spatially important regions were identified from fNIRS signals, and detailed neural patterns were extracted from EEG signals. Finally, the final prediction was obtained by weighting the sum of the prediction scores of the EEG and fNIRS-guided attention features to alleviate performance degradation owing to delayed fNIRS response. In the experimental results, the FGANet significantly outperformed the EEG-standalone network. Furthermore, the FGANet has 4.0% and 2.7% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithms in mental arithmetic and motor imagery tasks, respectively.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35130163/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35130163/,English,Include,,FGANet: fNIRS-Guided Attention Network for Hybrid EEG-fNIRS Brain-Computer Interfaces.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Independent and interactive components of neurons or brain regions can fully describe the brain. This paper constructed a relation frame based on the independent and interactive compositions for intention recognition and analysis using a novel dendrite module of Gang neurons. A total of 4,906 EEG data of left- and right-hand motor imagery (MI) from 26 subjects were obtained from GigaDB. Firstly, this paper explored EEGG's classification performance by cross-subject accuracy. Secondly, this paper transformed the trained EEGG model into a relation spectrum expressing independent and interactive components of brain regions. Then, the relation spectrum was verified using the known ERD/ERS phenomenon. Finally, this paper explored the previously unreachable further BCI-based analysis of the brain. (1) EEGG was more robust than typical ""CSP+"" algorithms for the low-quality data. (2) The relation spectrum showed the known ERD/ERS phenomenon.

EEG is one of the most commonly used techniques for brain signal acquisition in BCI. However, it is notoriously difficult to build a generic EEG recognition model due to significant non-stationarity and subject-to-subject variations, and the requirement for long time training. Transfer learning (TL) is particularly useful because it can alleviate the calibration requirement in EEG-based BCI applications by transferring the calibration information from existing subjects to new subject. To take advantage of geometric properties in Riemann manifold and joint distribution adaptation, a manifold embedded transfer learning (METL) framework was proposed for motor imagery (MI) EEG decoding. First, the covariance matrices of the EEG trials are first aligned on the SPD manifold. Then the features are extracted from both the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold and Grassmann manifold. Finally, the classification model is learned by combining the structural risk minimization (SRM) of source domain and joint distribution alignment of source and target domains. Experimental results on two MI EEG datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed METL. In particular, when there are a small amount of labeled samples in the target domain, METL demonstrated a more accurate and stable classification performance than conventional methods. Compared with several state-of-the-art methods, METL has achieved better classification accuracy, 71.81% and 69.06% in single-to-single (STS), 83.14% and 76.00% in multi-to-single (MTS) transfer tasks, respectively. METL can cope with single source domain or multi-source domains and compared with single-source transfer learning, multi-source transfer learning can improve the performance effectively due to the data expansion.

The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in MI-BCIs. However, its performance is adversely affected by variance in the operational frequency band and noise interference. Furthermore, the performance of CSP is not satisfactory when addressing multi-category classification problems. In this work, we propose a fusion method combining Filter Banks and Riemannian Tangent Space (FBRTS) in multiple time windows. FBRTS uses multiple filter banks to overcome the problem of variance in the operational frequency band. It also applies the Riemannian method to the covariance matrix extracted by the spatial filter to obtain more robust features in order to overcome the problem of noise interference. In addition, we use a One-Versus-Rest support vector machine (OVR-SVM) model to classify multi-category features. We evaluate our FBRTS method using BCI competition IV dataset 2a and 2b. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of our FBRTS method is 77.7% and 86.9% in datasets 2a and 2b respectively. By analyzing the influence of the different numbers of filter banks and time windows on the performance of our FBRTS method, we can identify the optimal number of filter banks and time windows.

Several studies defined the EEG with unique features, universality, and natural robustness to be used as a new track to prevent spoofing attacks. The EEG signals are a visual recording of the brain's electrical activities, measured by placing electrodes (channels) in various scalp positions. However, traditional EEG-based systems lead to high complexity with many channels, and some channels have critical information for the identification system while others do not. Several studies have proposed a single objective to address the EEG channel for person identification. Unfortunately, these studies only focused on increasing the accuracy rate without balancing the accuracy and the total number of selected EEG channels. The novelty of this paper is to propose a multiobjective binary version of the cuckoo search algorithm (MOBCS-KNN) to find optimal EEG channel selections for person identification. The proposed method (MOBCS-KNN) used a weighted sum technique to implement a multiobjective approach. In addition, a KNN classifier for EEG-based biometric person identification is used. It is worth mentioning that this is the initial investigation of using a multiobjective technique with EEG channel selection problem. A standard EEG motor imagery dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the MOBCS-KNN. The experiments show that the MOBCS-KNN obtained accuracy of 93.86% using only 24 sensors with AR20 autoregressive coefficients. Another critical point is that the MOBCS-KNN finds channels not too close to each other to capture relevant information from all over the head. In conclusion, the MOBCS-KNN algorithm achieves the best results compared with metaheuristic algorithms.

Successful single trial classification holds potential for translation into the clinical realm for real-time detection of memory and other cognitive states to provide real-time interventions (i.e., brain-computer interfaces). However, most of these studies-and classification analyses in general- do not make clear if the chosen methodology is optimally suited for the classification of memory-related brain states. To address this problem, we systematically compared different methods for every step of classification (i.e., feature extraction, feature selection, classifier selection) to investigate which methods work best for decoding episodic memory brain states-the first analysis of its kind. Using an adult lifespan sample EEG dataset collected during performance of an episodic context encoding and retrieval task, we found that no specific feature type (including Common Spatial Pattern (CSP)-based features, mean, variance, correlation, features based on AR model, entropy, phase, and phase synchronization) outperformed others consistently in distinguishing different memory classes. However, extracting all of these feature types consistently outperformed extracting only one type of feature. Additionally, the combination of filtering and sequential forward selection was the optimal method to select the effective features compared to filtering alone or performing no feature selection at all. Moreover, although all classifiers performed at a fairly similar level, LASSO was consistently the highest performing classifier compared to other commonly used options (i.e., naïve Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression) while naïve Bayes was the fastest classifier. Lastly, for multiclass classification (i.e., levels of context memory confidence and context feature perception), generalizing the binary classification using the binary decision tree performed better than the voting or one versus rest method. These methods were shown to outperform alternative approaches for three orthogonal datasets (i.e., EEG working memory, EEG motor imagery, and MEG working memory), supporting their generalizability. Our results provide an optimized methodological process for classifying single-trial neural data and provide important insight and recommendations for a cognitive neuroscientist's ability to make informed choices at all stages of the classification process for predicting memory and other cognitive states.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954026/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34954026/,English,Include,,Evaluation of classification approaches for distinguishing brain states predictive of episodic memory performance from electroencephalography: Abbreviated Title: Evaluating methods of classifying memory states from EEG.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Here we explored the neural features and decoding of Chinese sign language from electroencephalograph (EEG) signal with motor imagery and motor execution. Sign language not only contains rich semantic information, but also has abundant maneuverable actions, and provides us with more different executable commands. In this paper, twenty subjects were instructed to perform movement execution and movement imagery based on Chinese sign language.

We first extract the amplitude and phase sequences of users' multi-channel EEG signals based on the complex Morlet wavelet time-frequency maps, and then convert them into an undirected graph to extract EEG topological features. The graph-based features from EEG are then selected by a thresholding method and fused with the temporal features from fNIRS signals after each being selected by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The fused features were then classified as MI task vs. baseline by a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

The contribution is an effective hybridization of the Multiscale Principal Component Analysis (MSPCA), Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), statistical features extraction from subbands, and ensemble learning-based classifiers for categorization of the MI tasks. The intended electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are segmented and denoised. The denoising is achieved with a Daubechies algorithm-based wavelet transform (WT) incorporated in the MSPCA. The WT with the 5th level of decomposition is used. Onward, the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD), with the 4th level of decomposition, is used for subbands formation. The statistical features are selected from each subband, namely, mean absolute value, average power, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Also, ratios of absolute mean values of adjacent subbands are computed and concatenated with other extracted features.

Although numerous BCI studies have successfully decoded large body parts, such as the movement intention of both hands, arms, or legs, research on MI decoding of high-level behaviors such as hand grasping is essential to further expand the versatility of MI-based BCIs. In this study, we propose NeuroGrasp, a dual-stage deep learning framework that decodes multiple hand grasping from EEG signals under the MI paradigm. The proposed method effectively uses an EEG and electromyography (EMG)-based learning, such that EEG-based inference at test phase becomes possible. The EMG guidance during model training allows BCIs to predict hand grasp types from EEG signals accurately. Consequently, NeuroGrasp improved classification performance offline, and demonstrated a stable classification performance online. Across 12 subjects, we obtained an average offline classification accuracy of 0.68 (±0.09) in four-grasp-type classifications and 0.86 (±0.04) in two-grasp category classifications. In addition, we obtained an average online classification accuracy of 0.65 (±0.09) and 0.79 (±0.09) across six high-performance subjects.

Although innovative model structures are thoroughly explored, little attention was drawn toward the objective function. In most of the available CNNs in the MI area, the standard cross-entropy loss is usually performed as the objective function, which only ensures deep feature separability. Corresponding to the limitation of current objective functions, a new loss function with a combination of smoothed cross-entropy (with label smoothing) and center loss is proposed as the supervision signal for the model in the MI recognition task. Specifically, the smoothed cross-entropy is calculated by the entropy between the predicted labels and the one-hot hard labels regularized by a noise of uniform distribution. The center loss learns a deep feature center for each class and minimizes the distance between deep features and their corresponding centers. The proposed loss tries to optimize the model in two learning objectives, preventing overconfident predictions and increasing deep feature discriminative capacity (interclass separability and intraclass invariant), which guarantee the effectiveness of MI recognition models. We conduct extensive experiments on two well-known benchmarks (BCI competition IV-2a and IV-2b) to evaluate our method. The result indicates that the proposed approach achieves better performance than other SoA models on both datasets.

Thus, brain connectivity provides a promising approach to solving the stated shortcomings by considering inter-channel/region relationships during motor imagination. This study used effective connectivity in the brain in terms of the partial directed coherence (PDC) and directed transfer function (DTF) as intensively unconventional feature sets for motor imagery (MI) classification. MANOVA-based analysis was performed to identify statistically significant connectivity pairs. Furthermore, the study sought to predict MI patterns by using four classification algorithms-an SVM, KNN, decision tree, and probabilistic neural network. The study provides a comparative analysis of all of the classification methods using two-class MI data extracted from the PhysioNet EEG database. The proposed techniques based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) as a classifier and PDC as a feature set outperformed the other classification and feature extraction techniques with a superior classification accuracy and a lower error rate. The research findings indicate that when the PDC was used as a feature set, the PNN attained the greatest overall average accuracy of 98.65%, whereas the same classifier was used to attain the greatest accuracy of 82.81% with the DTF. This study validates the activation of multiple brain regions during a motor task by achieving better classification outcomes through brain connectivity as compared to conventional features. Since the PDC outperformed the DTF as a feature set with its superior classification accuracy and low error rate, it has great potential for application in MI-based brain-computer interfaces.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34640888/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34640888/,English,Include,,Effective Connectivity for Decoding Electroencephalographic Motor Imagery Using a Probabilistic Neural Network.,Exclude,Duplicate study,Duplicate group,,0.99,0.6,

In this work, we study directional and movement-related information in electroencephalographic signals acquired during a visually guided center-out motor imagery task in two conditions, i.e., with and without additional somatosensory input in the form of vibrotactile guidance. Imagined movements to the right and forward could be discriminated in low-frequency electroencephalographic amplitudes with group level peak accuracies of 70% with vibrotactile guidance, and 67% without vibrotactile guidance. The peak accuracies with and without vibrotactile guidance were not significantly different. Furthermore, the motor imagery could be classified against a resting baseline with group level accuracies between 76 and 83%, using either low-frequency amplitude features or μ and β power spectral features. On average, accuracies were higher with vibrotactile guidance, while this difference was only significant in the latter set of features.

The selection of time windows and frequency bands prominently affects the performance of CSP algorithms. Concerning the joint optimization of these two parameters, several studies have utilized a unified framework based on different feature selection strategies and achieved considerable improvement. However, during the feature selection process, useful information could be discarded inevitably and the underlying internal structure of features could be neglected. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework termed time window filter bank common spatial pattern with multi-view optimization (TWFBCSP-MVO) to further boost the decoding of MI tasks. Concretely, after extracting CSP features from different time-frequency decompositions of EEG signals, a preliminary screening strategy based on variance ratio was devised to filter out the unrelated spatial patterns. We then introduced a multi-view learning strategy for the simultaneous optimization of time windows and frequency bands. A support vector machine classifier was trained to determine the output of the brain. An experimental study was conducted on two public datasets to verify the effectiveness of TWFBCSP-MVO.

Currently, this bio-engineering-based technology is being employed by researchers in various fields to develop cutting-edge applications. The classification of real-time MI-EEG signals is the most challenging task in these applications. The prediction performance of the existing classification methods is still limited due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behaviors of the real-time EEG data. To enhance the classification performance of real-time BCI applications, this paper presents a new clustering-based ensemble technique called CluSem to mitigate this problem.

In this game, real-time EEG signal classification and prediction tabulation through animated balls are controlled via threads. By playing this game, users can control the movements of the balls via the brain signals of motor imagery movements without using any traditional input devices.

However, a large amount of labeled data has to be collected for each new subject since EEG patterns vary between individuals. The long calibration phase severely limits the further development of MI-BCI. To tackle this problem, multi-source joint domain adaption (MJDA) and multi-source joint Riemannian adaption (MJRA) algorithms are proposed in this paper. Both methods aim to transfer knowledge from other subjects to the current subject who has only a small amount of labeled data. First, the common spatial pattern with Euclidean alignment is used to select source subjects who have similar spatial patterns to the target subject. Second, the covariance matrices of EEG trials are aligned in Riemannian space by removing subject-specific baselines. These two steps are shared by MJDA and MJRA. In the last step, MJDA attempts to minimize the feature distribution mismatch in the Riemannian tangent space, while MJRA attempts to find an adaptive Riemannian classifier. Finally, the proposed methods are validated on two datasets: BCI Competition IV 2a and online event-related desynchronization (ERD)-BCI.

Based upon multimodal spatio-spectral feature extraction and Naïve Bayes classification, we developed, for the first time, a novel LFP-EEG-BCI for motor intention decoding. A transfer learning (TL) approach was employed to further improve the feasibility. The performance of the proposed LFP-EEG-BCI for four-class upper-limb motor intention decoding was assessed. Using a decision fusion strategy, we showed that the LFP-EEG-BCI significantly (p 0.05) outperformed single modal BCI (LFP-BCI and EEG-BCI) in terms of decoding accuracy with the best performance achieved using regularized common spatial pattern features. Interrogation of feature characteristics revealed discriminative spatial and spectral patterns, which may lead to new insights for better understanding of brain dynamics during different motor imagery tasks and promote development of efficient decoding algorithms. Moreover, we showed that similar classification performance could be obtained with few training trials, therefore highlighting the efficacy of TL.

Therefore, the mental rehearsal of movements is often used to supplement physical training and might aid motor neurorehabilitation after stroke. One attempt to capture the brain's involvement in imagery involves the use, as a marker, of the depression or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of thalamocortical sensorimotor rhythms found in a human electroencephalogram (EEG). Using fast real-time processing, it is possible to make the subject aware of their own brain reactions or-even better-to turn them into actions through a technology called the brain-computer interface (BCI). However, it remains unclear whether BCI-enabled imagery facilitates a stronger or qualitatively different brain response compared to the open-loop training. Seven healthy volunteers who were experienced in both closed and open-loop motor imagery took part in six experimental sessions over a period of 4.5 months, in which they performed kinesthetic imagery of a previously known set of finger and arm movements with simultaneous 30-channel EEG acquisition. The first and the last session mostly consisted of feedback trials in which the subjects were presented with the classification results of the EEG patterns in real time; during the other sessions, no feedback was provided. Spatiotemporal and amplitude features of the ERD patterns concomitant with imagery were compared across experimental days and between feedback conditions using linear mixed-effects modeling. The main spatial sources of ERD appeared to be highly stable across the six experimental days, remaining nearly identical in five of seven subjects (Pearson's ρ > 0.94).

Several approaches have been proposed to manage stroke patient rehabilitation such as robotic devices and virtual reality systems, and researchers have found that the brain-computer interfaces (BCI) approaches can provide better results. Therefore, the most challenging tasks with BCI applications involve identifying the best technique(s) that can reveal the neuron stimulus information from the patients' brains and extracting the most effective features from these signals as well. Accordingly, the main novelty of this paper is twofold: propose a new feature fusion method for motor imagery (MI)-based BCI and develop an automatic MI framework to detect the changes pre- and post-rehabilitation. This study investigated the electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from post-stroke patients with upper extremity hemiparesis. All patients performed 25 MI-based BCI sessions with follow up assessment visits to examine the functional changes before and after EEG neurorehabilitation. In the first stage, conventional filters and automatic independent component analysis with wavelet transform (AICA-WT) denoising technique were used. Next, attributes from time, entropy and frequency domains were computed, and the effective features were combined into time-entropy-frequency (TEF) attributes. Consequently, the AICA-WT and the TEF fusion set were utilised to develop an AICA-WT-TEF framework. Then, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and random forest (RF) classification technique were tested for MI-based BCI rehabilitation. The proposed AICA-WT-TEF framework with RF classifier achieves the best results compared with other classifiers. Finally, the proposed framework and feature fusion set achieve a significant performance in terms of accuracy measures compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the proposed methods could be crucial for improving the process of automatic MI rehabilitation and are recommended for implementation in real-time applications.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34478922/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34478922/,English,Include,,EEG feature fusion for motor imagery: A new robust framework towards stroke patients rehabilitation.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

A BCI system requires a lengthy calibration phase to produce a reasonable classifier. To reduce the duration of the calibration phase, it is natural to attempt to create a subject-independent classifier with all subject datasets that are available; however, electroencephalogram (EEG) data have notable inter-subject variability. Thus, it is very challenging to achieve subject-independent BCI performance comparable to subject-specific BCI performance. In this study, we investigate the potential for achieving better subject-independent motor imagery BCI performance by conducting comparative performance tests with several selective subject pooling strategies (i.e., choosing subjects who yield reasonable performance selectively and using them for training) rather than using all subjects available.

However, information is excessively compressed in the present MI-EEG image, and the sequential CNN is unfavorable for the comprehensive utilization of local features. In this paper, a multidimensional MI-EEG imaging method is proposed, which is based on time-frequency analysis and the Clough-Tocher (CT) interpolation algorithm. The time-frequency matrix of each electrode is generated via continuous wavelet transform (WT), and the relevant section of frequency is extracted and divided into nine submatrices, the longitudinal sums and lengths of which are calculated along the directions of frequency and time successively to produce a 3 × 3 feature matrix for each electrode. Then, feature matrix of each electrode is interpolated to coincide with their corresponding coordinates, thereby yielding a WT-based multidimensional image, called WTMI. Meanwhile, a multilevel and multiscale feature fusion convolutional neural network (MLMSFFCNN) is designed for WTMI, which has dense information, low signal-to-noise ratio, and strong spatial distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, and accuracies of 92.95% and 97.03% are yielded based on 10-fold cross-validation, respectively, which exceed those of the state-of-the-art imaging methods. The kappa values and p values demonstrate that our method has lower class skew and error costs.

We develop a new approach of domain adaptation based on optimal transport to tackle brain signal variability between sessions of motor imagery BCIs. We propose a backward method where, unlike the original formulation, the data from a new session are transported to a calibration session, and thereby avoiding model retraining. Several domain adaptation approaches are evaluated and compared. We simulated two possible online scenarios: i) block-wise adaptation and ii) sample-wise adaptation. In this study, we collect a dataset of 10 subjects performing a hand motor imagery task in 2 sessions. A publicly available dataset is also used. For the first scenario, results indicate that classifier retraining can be avoided by means of our backward formulation yielding to equivalent classification performance as compared to retraining solutions. In the second scenario, classification performance rises up to 90.23% overall accuracy when the label of the indicated mental task is used to learn the transport. Adaptive time is between 10 and 80 times faster than the other methods. The proposed method is able to mitigate the cross-session variability in motor imagery BCIs. The backward formulation is an efficient retraining-free approach built to avoid lengthy calibration times. Thus, the BCI can be actively used after just a few minutes of setup.

In this paper, we designed a novel CSP feature selection framework that combines the filter method and the wrapper method. We first evaluated the importance of every CSP feature by the infinite latent feature selection method. Meanwhile, we calculated Wasserstein distance between feature distributions of the same feature under different tasks. Then, we redefined the importance of every CSP feature based on two indicators mentioned above, which eliminates half of CSP features to create a new CSP feature subspace according to the new importance indicator. At last, we designed the improved binary gravitational search algorithm (IBGSA) by rebuilding its transfer function and applied IBGSA on the new CSP feature subspace to find the optimal feature set.

Recent deep learning methods, which fail to fully explore both deep-temporal characterizations in EEGs itself and multi-spectral information in different rhythms, generally ignore the temporal or spectral dependencies in MI-EEG. Also, the lack of effective feature fusion probably leads to redundant or irrelative information and thus fails to achieve the most discriminative features, resulting in the limited MI-EEG decoding performance. To address these issues, in this paper, a MI-EEG decoding framework is proposed, which uses a novel temporal-spectral-based squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion network (TS-SEFFNet). First, the deep-temporal convolution block (DT-Conv block) implements convolutions in a cascade architecture, which extracts high-dimension temporal representations from raw EEG signals. Second, the multi-spectral convolution block (MS-Conv block) is then conducted in parallel using multi-level wavelet convolutions to capture discriminative spectral features from corresponding clinical subbands. Finally, the proposed squeeze-and-excitation feature fusion block (SE-Feature-Fusion block) maps the deep-temporal and multi-spectral features into comprehensive fused feature maps, which highlights channel-wise feature responses by constructing interdependencies among different domain features.

The combination of source-imaging and analysis of cortical directional networks enables us to noninvasively explore the underlying neural processes. However, existing EEG source imaging approaches mainly focus on performing the direct inverse operation for source estimation, which will be inevitably influenced by noise and the strategy used to find the inverse solution. Here, we develop a new source imaging technique, Deep Brain Neural Network (DeepBraiNNet), for robust sparse spatiotemporal EEG source estimation. In DeepBraiNNet, considering that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are usually ""deep"" in temporal dimension and thus suitable for time sequence modelling, the RNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is utilized to approximate the inverse operation for the lead field matrix instead of performing the direct inverse operation, which avoids the possible effect of the direct inverse operation on the underdetermined lead field matrix prone to be influenced by noise. Simulations on various source patterns and noise conditions confirmed that the proposed approach could actually recover the spatiotemporal sources well, outperforming existing state of-the-art methods. DeepBraiNNet also estimated sparse MI related activation patterns when it was applied to a real Motor Imagery dataset, consistent with other findings based on EEG and fMRI.

Motivated by this context, this work aims to design and construct the Hand Exoskeleton for Rehabilitation Objectives (HERO) to recover extension and flexion movements of the fingers. A three-dimensional (3D) printing technique in association with textiles was used to produce a lightweight and wearable device. 3D-printed actuators have also been designed to reduce equipment costs. The actuator transforms the torque of DC motors into linear force transmitted by Bowden cables to move the fingers passively. The exoskeleton was controlled by neuroelectric signal-electroencephalography (EEG). Concept tests were performed to evaluate control performance. A healthy volunteer was submitted to a training session with the exoskeleton, according to the Graz-BCI protocol.

One of the most common paradigms of BCI systems is motor imagery. Currently, to classify motor imagery EEG signals, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) are extensively used. Generally, the recorded motor imagery EEG signals in BCI are noisy, non-stationary, thus significantly reducing the BCI system's performance. It is shown that the CSP algorithm has a good performance in the classification of various types of motor imagery data. However, once the number of trials is low, or the data are noisy, overfitting will probably occur, which precludes extracting an appropriate spatial filter. Another drawback of the CSP is that it only extracts spatial-based filters. Therefore, the current study attempts to decrease the probability of overfitting in the CSP algorithm by presenting an improved method called Ensemble Regularized Common Spatio-Spectral Pattern (Ensemble RCSSP).

We propose a novel approach that maps the probability of an EEG epoch to be artifactual based on four different statistical measures: entropy (a measure of uncertainty), kurtosis (a measure of peakedness), skewness (a measure of asymmetry), and periodic waveform index (a measure of periodicity). Then, a stationary wavelet transform based artifact removal is proposed that employs a particular probability threshold provided by the user. We have executed our experiments with both synthetic and real EEG data. It is observed that the proposed method exhibits a superior performance for suppressing the artifact contaminated from EEG with minimum distortion. Moreover, evaluation of the algorithm using EEG dataset for BCI experiments reveals that artifact removal can considerably improve the BCI output in both event-related potential and motor-imagery based BCI applications. The proposed algorithm has been applied to both real and synthesized data testing and compared with other state-of-the-art automated artifact removal methods.

We investigate and validate changes in LRTCs during five different types of movements and motor imagery tasks using two independent EEG datasets recorded with two different paradigms-our finger tapping dataset with single self-initiated asynchronous finger taps and publicly available EEG dataset containing cued continuous movement and motor imagery of fists and feet. We quantified instantaneous changes in broadband LRTCs by detrended fluctuation analysis on single trial 2 s EEG sliding windows. The broadband LRTC increased significantly (",,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34121989/,English,Exclude,Not classification-focused,Dynamics of Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Different Motor Execution and Imagery Tasks.,,,,,0.85,0.6,

To address this gap in knowledge, we considered a group of 20 healthy subjects during an EEG-based hand motor imagery (MI) task. We studied two well-established FC estimators, i.e. spectral- and imaginary-coherence, and we investigated how they were modulated by the MI task. We characterized the resulting FC networks by extracting the strength of connectivity of each EEG sensor and we compared the discriminant power with respect to standard power spectrum features. At the group level, results showed that while spectral-coherence based network features were increasing in the sensorimotor areas, those based on imaginary-coherence were significantly decreasing. We demonstrated that this opposite, but complementary, behavior was respectively determined by the increase in amplitude and phase synchronization between the brain signals. At the individual level, we eventually assessed the potential of these network connectivity features in a simple off-line classification scenario.

We used electroencephalography signals from eleven healthy controls and eleven stroke patients in this study. The subjects performed a finger tapping task during motor execution, and motor imagery was performed with the dominant and affected hands in the healthy controls and stroke patients, respectively. All fingers except for the thumb were classified using the proposed framework based on a voting module.

However, in the cross-subject classification, due to the individual differences between different subjects, the performance is limited. This paper introduces the idea of transfer learning and presents the sub-band target alignment common spatial pattern (SBTACSP) method and applies it to the cross-subject classification of motor imagery (MI) EEG signals. First, the EEG signals are bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands (sub-band filtering). Subsequently, the source domain trails are aligned into the target domain space in each frequency band. The CSP algorithm is then employed to extract features among which more representative features are selected by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) approach from each sub-band. Then the features of all sub-bands are fused. Finally, conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm is used for MI classification. Our method is evaluated on Datasets Ⅱa and Ⅱb of the BCI Competition Ⅳ. Compared with six state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed SBTACSP method performed relatively the best and achieved a mean classification accuracy of 75.15% and 66.85% in cross-subject classification of Datasets Ⅱa and Ⅱb respectively.

One of the most popular approaches to BCI is motor imagery (MI). In BCI applications, the electroencephalography (EEG) is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its noninvasive nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals. This difficulty lies in the selection of the correct EEG channels, the signal-to-noise ratio of these signals, and how to discern the redundant information among them. BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and decision making. In this article, we define a new BCI framework, called enhanced fusion framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks. First, we include an additional preprocessing step of the signal: a differentiation of the EEG signal that makes it time invariant. Second, we add an additional frequency band as a feature for the system: the sensorimotor rhythm band, and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations, Choquet and Sugeno integrals, and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers performing MI-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new system achieved 88.80% accuracy.

However, in modern society, more and more diseases threaten the health of the brain and nerves and spinal cord, making the human brain unable to conduct normal information interaction with the outside world. The rehabilitation training of the brain-computer interface can promote the nerve repair of the sensorimotor cortex in patients with brain diseases. Therefore, the research of brain-computer interface for motor imaging is of great significance for patients with brain diseases to restore motor function. Due to the characteristics of non-stationary, nonlinear, and individual differences of EEG signals, there are still many difficulties in the analysis and classification of EEG signals at this stage. In this study, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model was used to classify motor-imaging EEG signals, identify the user's intention, and control external devices.

The fusion features are input to the trained ELM classifier, and the final classification result is obtained. Two sets of BCI competition data in the BCI competition public database are used to verify the validity of the model.

Promising candidates include interictal high-frequency oscillation and phase-amplitude coupling. Investigators have independently created the toolboxes that compute the high-frequency oscillation rate and the severity of phase-amplitude coupling. This study of 135 patients determined what toolboxes and analytic approaches would optimally classify patients achieving post-operative seizure control. Four different detector toolboxes computed the rate of high-frequency oscillation at ≥80 Hz at intracranial EEG channels. Another toolbox calculated the modulation index reflecting the strength of phase-amplitude coupling between high-frequency oscillation and slow-wave at 3-4 Hz. We defined the completeness of resection of interictally-abnormal regions as the subtraction of high-frequency oscillation rate (or modulation index) averaged across all preserved sites from that averaged across all resected sites. We computed the outcome classification accuracy of the logistic regression-based standard model considering clinical, ictal intracranial EEG and neuroimaging variables alone. We then determined how well the incorporation of high-frequency oscillation/modulation index would improve the standard model mentioned above. To assess the anatomical variability across non-epileptic sites, we generated the normative atlas of detector-specific high-frequency oscillation and modulation index. Each atlas allowed us to compute the statistical deviation of high-frequency oscillation/modulation index from the non-epileptic mean. We determined whether the model accuracy would be improved by incorporating absolute or normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index as a biomarker assessing interictally-abnormal regions. We finally determined whether the model accuracy would be improved by selectively incorporating high-frequency oscillation verified to have high-frequency oscillatory components unattributable to a high-pass filtering effect. Ninety-five patients achieved successful seizure control, defined as International League against Epilepsy class 1 outcome. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that complete resection of interictally-abnormal regions additively increased the chance of success. The model accuracy was further improved by incorporating z-score normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index or selective incorporation of verified high-frequency oscillation. The standard model had a classification accuracy of 0.75. Incorporation of normalized high-frequency oscillation/modulation index or verified high-frequency oscillation improved the classification accuracy up to 0.82.

In analysis of EEG data, achieving a higher classification performance is dependent on the appropriate representation of EEG features which is mostly characterized by one unique frequency before applying a learning model. Neglecting other frequencies of EEG signals could deteriorate the recognition performance of the model because each frequency has its unique advantages. Motivated by this idea, we propose to obtain distinguishable features with different frequencies by introducing an integrated deep learning model to accurately classify multiple classes of upper limb movement intentions. The proposed model is a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) and stacked autoencoder (SAE). To validate the method, four high-level amputees were recruited to perform five motor intention tasks. The acquired EEG signals were first preprocessed before exploring the consequence of input representation on the performance of LSTM-SAE by feeding four frequency bands related to the tasks into the model. The learning model was further improved by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to eliminate feature redundancy, and to enhance the motor intention recognition.

An example is the occurrence of an error in BCI systems. Investigation of the ErRP could enable researchers to increase the accuracy of BCI systems by detecting instances of inaccuracy in the system. In this research the effects of two parameters on the ErRP are studied: (1) The Motor Imagery Time, also known as Inter-Stimulus Interval (ISI) and (2) different types of feedback (Visual and Tactile). The statistical analysis of the ErRP characteristics showed that feedback type meaningfully affects the ErRP in a cue-paced BCI system and it will affect the time of occurrence of this potential.

To solve this problem, a novel convolutional neural network based on temporal-spatial feature learning (TSCNN) was proposed for motor imagery EEG decoding.

Then, 2-layer two-dimensional convolutional structures were adopted to learn abstract features from the raw temporal-spatial features.

However, not all users have the ability to sufficiently modulate their brain activity for control of a MI-BCI; a problem known as BCI illiteracy or inefficiency. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and the cause of such difference among users is yet not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of several cognitive and psychological measures on MI-BCI performance. Fifty-five novice BCI-users participated in a left- versus right-hand motor imagery task. In addition to their BCI classification error rate and demographics, psychological measures including personality factors, affinity for technology, and motivation during the experiment, as well as cognitive measures including visuospatial memory and spatial ability and Vividness of Visual Imagery were collected. Factors that were found to have a significant impact on MI-BCI performance were Vividness of Visual Imagery, and the personality factors of orderliness and autonomy.

However, electroencephalography (EEG), a commonly used brain imaging method for BCI, is characterized by a tedious experimental setup, frequent data loss due to artifacts, and is time consuming for bulk trial recordings to take advantage of the capabilities of deep learning classifiers. Some studies have tried to address this issue by generating artificial EEG signals. However, a few of these methods are limited in retaining the prominent features or biomarker of the signal. And, other deep learning-based generative methods require a huge number of samples for training, and a majority of these models can handle data augmentation of one category or class of data at any training session. Therefore, there exists a necessity for a generative model that can generate synthetic EEG samples with as few available trials as possible and generate multi-class while retaining the biomarker of the signal. Since EEG signal represents an accumulation of action potentials from neuronal populations beneath the scalp surface and as spiking neural network (SNN), a biologically closer artificial neural network, communicates via spiking behavior, we propose an SNN-based approach using surrogate-gradient descent learning to reconstruct and generate multi-class artificial EEG signals from just a few original samples.

In traditional EEG-based BCI setup, after applying pre-processing like band-pass filtering and spatial filtering, features are extracted and are fed to the classifier. However, most of the traditional features are extracted from a single time window, which is usually the full-time frame of a cue-based MI signal. Such features are usually statistical characteristics like log-variance of the whole-time signal. Thus, the information, which is localised in time and crucial for subject-specific MI classification, is not best captured. In this work, a new time-localised approach is proposed where multiple time windows are used for feature extraction. We have developed a number of feature representations using those time windows.

Motor imagery of single-handed actions is used in BCIs but many users cannot control the BCIs effectively, limiting applications in the health systems. Crosstalk is unintended brain activations that interfere with bimanual actions and could also occur during motor imagery. To test if crosstalk impaired BCI user performance, we recorded EEG in 46 participants while they imagined movements in four experimental conditions using motor imagery: left hand (L), right hand (R), tongue (T) and feet (F). Pairwise classification accuracies of the tasks were compared (LR, LF, LT, RF, RT, FT), using common spatio-spectral filters and linear discriminant analysis. We hypothesized that LR classification accuracy would be lower than every other combination that included a hand imagery due to crosstalk. As predicted, classification accuracy for LR (58%) was reliably the lowest. Interestingly, participants who showed poor LR classification also demonstrated at least one good TR, TL, FR or FL classification; and good LR classification was detected in 16% of the participants. For the first time, we showed that crosstalk occurred in motor imagery, and affected BCI performance negatively. Such effects are effector-sensitive regardless of the BCI methods used; and likely not apparent to the user or the BCI developer. This means that tasks choice is crucial when designing BCI.

In this paper, we discuss a solution to this problem based on a novel step-by-step method of feature extraction and pattern classification for multiclass MI-EEG signals. First, the training data from all subjects is merged and enlarged through autoencoder to meet the need for massive amounts of data while reducing the bad effect on signal recognition because of randomness, instability, and individual variability of EEG data. Second, an end-to-end sharing structure with attention-based time-incremental shallow convolution neural network is proposed. Shallow convolution neural network (SCNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network are used to extract frequency-spatial domain features and time-series features of EEG signals, respectively. Then, the attention model is introduced into the feature fusion layer to dynamically weight these extracted temporal-frequency-spatial domain features, which greatly contributes to the reduction of feature redundancy and the improvement of classification accuracy. At last, validation tests using BCI Competition IV 2a data sets show that classification accuracy and kappa coefficient have reached 82.7 ± 5.57% and 0.78 ± 0.074, which can strongly prove its advantages in improving classification accuracy and reducing individual difference among different subjects from the same network.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33679965/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33679965/,English,Include,,A Novel Time-Incremental End-to-End Shared Neural Network with Attention-Based Feature Fusion for Multiclass Motor Imagery Recognition.,Include,,"In the research of motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI), traditional electroencephalogram (EEG) signal recognition algorithms appear to be inefficient in extracting EEG signal features and improving classific",,0.95,0.6,

The classification of ESs and surgery in patients without lesions apparent on MRI is challenging. Total corpus callosotomy (TCC) is a surgical option for diagnosis of the lateralization and possible treatment for ESs. This study investigated phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of fast activity modulated by slow waves on scalp electroencephalography (EEG) to evaluate the strength of the modulation index (MI) before and after disconnection surgery in children with intractable nonlesional ESs. The authors hypothesize that a decreased MI due to surgery correlates with good seizure outcomes. The authors studied 10 children with ESs without lesions on MRI who underwent disconnection surgeries. Scalp EEG was obtained before and after surgery. The authors collected 20 epochs of 3 minutes each during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The MI of the gamma (30-70 Hz) amplitude and delta (0.5-4 Hz) phase was obtained in each electrode. MIs for each electrode were averaged in 4 brain areas (left/right, anterior/posterior quadrants) and evaluated to determine the correlation with seizure outcomes. The median age at first surgery was 2.3 years (range 10 months-9.1 years). Two patients with focal onset ESs underwent anterior quadrant disconnection (AQD). TCC alone was performed in 5 patients with generalized or unknown onset ESs. Two patients achieved seizure freedom. Three patients had residual generalized onset ESs. Disconnection surgeries in addition to TCC consisted of TCC + posterior quadrant disconnection (PQD) (1 patient); TCC + AQD + PQD (1 patient); and TCC + AQD + hemispherotomy (1 patient). Seven patients became seizure free with a mean follow-up period of 28 months (range 5-54 months). After TCC, MIs in 4 quadrants were significantly lower in the 2 seizure-free patients than in the 6 patients with residual ESs (p < 0.001). After all 15 disconnection surgeries in 10 patients, MIs in the 13 target quadrants for each disconnection surgery that resulted in freedom from seizures were significantly lower than in the 26 target quadrants in patients with residual ESs (p < 0.001). In children with nonlesional ESs, PAC for scalp EEG before and after disconnection surgery may be a surrogate marker for control of ESs. The MI may indicate epileptogenic neuronal modulation of the interhemispheric corpus callosum and intrahemispheric subcortical network for ESs.

We observe that the optimized minimal EEG-channel sets are automatically selected in all three cases. Their decoding accuracies using the minimal channels are statistically equivalent to (or even higher than) those based on all channels.

In addition, a weighted BFN is constructed and expressed by the sum of the existing edge weights to characterize the cerebral cortex activation degree in different movement patterns. Then, on the basis of the topological structures of seven mental tasks, three regional networks centered on the C3, C4, and Cz channels are constructed, which are consistent with correspondence between limb movement patterns and cerebral cortex in neurophysiology. Furthermore, the CIR of each regional functional network is calculated to form three-dimensional vectors. Finally, we use the support vector machine to learn a classifier for multiclass MI tasks.

Specifically, we explore the global discriminator to align the marginal distribution across domains, and the local discriminator to reduce the conditional distribution discrepancy between sub-domains via conditioning on deep representation as well as the predicted labels from the classifier. In addition, we further investigate a dynamic adversarial factor to adaptively estimate the relative importance of alignment between the marginal and conditional distributions.

Therefore, accurate decoding of electroencephalography- (EEG-) based motion imagination has received a lot of attention, especially in the research of rehabilitation training.

Firstly, a multifrequency brain network is constructed from the multichannel MI-related EEG signals, and each layer corresponds to a specific brain frequency band. The structure of the multifrequency brain network matches the activity profile of the brain properly, which combines the information of channel and multifrequency. The filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm filters the MI-based EEG signals in the spatial domain to extract features. Further, a multilayer convolutional network model is designed to distinguish different MI tasks accurately, which allows extracting and exploiting the topology in the multifrequency brain network.

However, the existing deep learning-based methods usually only adopt the constraint of classification loss, which hardly obtains the features with high discrimination and limits the improvement of EEG decoding accuracy. In this paper, a discriminative feature learning strategy is proposed to improve the discrimination of features, which includes the central distance loss (CD-loss), the central vector shift strategy, and the central vector update process. First, the CD-loss is proposed to make the same class of samples converge to the corresponding central vector. Then, the central vector shift strategy extends the distance between different classes of samples in the feature space. Finally, the central vector update process is adopted to avoid the non-convergence of CD-loss and weaken the influence of the initial value of central vectors on the final results. In addition, overfitting is another severe challenge for deep learning-based EEG decoding methods. To deal with this problem, a data augmentation method based on circular translation strategy is proposed to expand the experimental datasets without introducing any extra noise or losing any information of the original data. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct some experiments on two public motor imagery EEG datasets (BCI competition IV 2a and 2b dataset), respectively.

EEG is a noninvasive neuroimaging technique, which can be used to decode user intentions. Because the feature space of EEG data is highly dimensional and signal patterns are specific to the subject, appropriate methods for feature representation are required to enhance the decoding accuracy of the CNN model. Furthermore, neural changes exhibit high variability between sessions, subjects within a single session, and trials within a single subject, resulting in major issues during the modeling stage. In addition, there are many subject-dependent factors, such as frequency ranges, time intervals, and spatial locations at which the signal occurs, which prevent the derivation of a robust model that can achieve the parameterization of these factors for a wide range of subjects.

Although great improvement has been achieved in MI-BCIs performance over recent years, they still suffer from inter- and intra-subject variability issues. As an attempt to cope with this, some studies have suggested that MI training should aid users to appropriately modulate their response for BCI usage: generally, this training is performed based on the sensorimotor rhythms' modulation over the primary sensorimotor cortex (PMC), with the signal being feedbacked to the user. Nonetheless, recent studies have revisited the actual involvement of the PMC into MI, and little to no attention has been devoted to understanding the participation of other cortical areas into training protocols. Therefore, in this work, our aim was to analyze the response induced by hands MI of 10 healthy subjects in the form of event-related desynchronizations (ERDs) and to assess whether features from beyond the PMC might be useful for hands MI classification. We investigated how this response occurs for distinct frequency intervals between 7-30 Hz, and ex0plored changes in their evocation pattern across 12 MI training sessions without feedback. Overall, we found that ERD patterns occur differently for the frequencies encompassed by the μ and β bands, with its evocation being favored for the first band. Over time, the no-feedback approach was inefficient to aid in enhancing ERD evocation (EO). Moreover, to some extent, EO tends to decrease over blocks within a given run, and runs within an MI session, but remains stable within an MI block.

Several methods have been suggested for the truncating of this undesirable time, including various variants of the popular CSP method. In this study, we cope with the problem, using local activities estimation (LAE). LAE is a spatial filtering technique that uses the EEG data of all electrodes along with their position information to emphasize the local activities. After spatial filtering by LAE, a few electrodes are selected based on physiological information. Then the features are extracted from the signal using FFT and classified by the support vector machine. In this study, the LAE is compared with CSP, RCSP, FBCSP and FBRCSP in two different electrode configurations of 118 and 64-channel. The LAE outperforms CSP-based methods in all experiments using the different number of training samples. The LAE method also obtains an average classification accuracy of 84% even with a calibration time of fewer than 2 min Significance: Unlike CSP-based methods, the LAE does not use the covariance matrix, and also uses a priori physiological information. Therefore, LAE can significantly reduce the calibration time while maintaining proper accuracy.

Survivors may recover some motor functions after rehabilitation therapy. However, many stroke patients missed the best time period for recovery and entered into the sequela stage of chronic stroke. Studies have shown that motor imagery- (MI-) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has a positive effect on poststroke rehabilitation. This study used both virtual limbs and functional electrical stimulation (FES) as feedback to provide patients with a closed-loop sensorimotor integration for motor rehabilitation. An MI-based BCI system acquired, analyzed, and classified motor attempts from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The FES system would be activated if the BCI detected that the user was imagining wrist dorsiflexion on the instructed side of the body. Sixteen stroke patients in the sequela stage were randomly assigned to a BCI group and a control group. All of them participated in rehabilitation training for four weeks and were assessed by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of motor function. The average improvement score of the BCI group was 3.5, which was higher than that of the control group (0.9). The active EEG patterns of the four patients in the BCI group whose FMA scores increased gradually became centralized and shifted to sensorimotor areas and premotor areas throughout the study. Study results showed evidence that patients in the BCI group achieved larger functional improvements than those in the control group and that the BCI-FES system is effective in restoring motor function to upper extremities in stroke patients.

To overcome this, many transfer-based approaches have been proposed, in which deep networks are trained using pre-existing data from other subjects and evaluated on new target subjects. This mode of transfer learning however faces the challenge of substantial inter-subject variability in brain data. Addressing this, in this paper, we propose 5 schemes for adaptation of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based electroencephalography (EEG)-BCI system for decoding hand motor imagery (MI).

Nonetheless, the electroencephalography (EEG) pattern variations among different subjects necessitates collecting a large amount of labeled individual data for model training, which prolongs the calibration session. From the perspective of transfer learning, the model knowledge inherent in reference subjects incorporating few target EEG data have the potential to solve the above issue. Thus, a novel knowledge-leverage-based support matrix machine (KL-SMM) was developed to improve the classification performance when only a few labeled EEG data in the target domain (target subject) were available. The proposed KL-SMM possesses the powerful capability of a matrix learning machine, which allows it to directly learn the structural information from matrix-form EEG data. In addition, the KL-SMM can not only fully leverage few labeled EEG data from the target domain during the learning procedure but can also leverage the existing model knowledge from the source domain (source subject). Therefore, the KL-SMM can enhance the generalization performance of the target classifier while guaranteeing privacy protection to a certain extent. Finally, the objective function of the KL-SMM can be easily optimized using the alternating direction method of multipliers method.

However, the implementation of non-invasive MI-based BCIs with more than three commands is still a difficult task. First, the number of MIs for decoding different actions is limited by the constraint of maintaining an adequate spacing among the corresponding sources, since the electroencephalography (EEG) activity from near regions may add up. Second, EEG generates a rather noisy image of brain activity, which results in a poor classification performance. Here, we propose a solution to address the limitation of identifiable motor activities by using combined MIs (i.e., MIs involving 2 or more body parts at the same time). And we propose two new multilabel uses of the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, namely MC2CMI and MC2SMI approaches. We recorded EEG signals from seven healthy subjects during an 8-class EEG experiment including the rest condition and all possible combinations using the left hand, right hand, and feet. The proposed multilabel approaches convert the original 8-class problem into a set of three binary problems to facilitate the use of the CSP algorithm. In the case of the MC2CMI method, each binary problem groups together in one class all the MIs engaging one of the three selected body parts, while the rest of MIs that do not engage the same body part are grouped together in the second class. In this way, for each binary problem, the CSP algorithm produces features to determine if the specific body part is engaged in the task or not. Finally, three sets of features are merged together to predict the user intention by applying an 8-class linear discriminant analysis. The MC2SMI method is quite similar, the only difference is that any of the combined MIs is considered during the training phase, which drastically accelerates the calibration time. For all subjects, both the MC2CMI and the MC2SMI approaches reached a higher accuracy than the classic pair-wise (PW) and one-vs.-all (OVA) methods.

Our assumption is that there are causal interactions between the channels of EEG signal in MI tasks that are repeated in different trials of a BCI and NF experiment. Therefore, a novel method for EEG channel selection is proposed which is based on Granger causality (GC) analysis. Additionally, the machine-learning approach is used to cluster independent component analysis (ICA) components of the EEG signal into artifact and normal EEG clusters.

This study proposes a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system for assisting people with limb motor disabilities in performing their daily life activities by using their brain signals to control assistive devices. The extraction of useful features is vital for an efficient BCI system. Therefore, the proposed system consists of a hybrid feature set that feeds into three machine-learning (ML) classifiers to classify motor Imagery (MI) tasks. This hybrid feature selection (FS) system is practical, real-time, and an efficient BCI with low computation cost. We investigate different combinations of channels to select the combination that has the highest impact on performance. The results indicate that the highest achieved accuracies using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier are 93.46% and 86.0% for the BCI competition III-IVa dataset and the autocalibration and recurrent adaptation dataset, respectively. These datasets are used to test the performance of the proposed BCI. Also, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed BCI by comparing its performance with recent studies. We show that the proposed system is accurate and efficient. Future work can apply the proposed system to individuals with limb motor disabilities to assist them and test their capability to improve their QoL. Moreover, the forthcoming work can examine the system's performance in controlling assistive devices such as wheelchairs or artificial limbs.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33212777/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33212777/,English,Include,,A BCI System Based on Motor Imagery for Assisting People with Motor Deficiencies in the Limbs.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Research to date mainly focused on classifying left vs. right hand/foot MI of stroke patients. Though a very few studies have reported decoding imagined hand movement directions using electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCI, the experiments were conducted on healthy subjects. Our work analyzes MI-based brain cortical activity from EEG signals and decodes the imagined hand movement directions in stroke patients. The decoded direction (left vs. right) of hand movement imagination is used to provide control commands to a motorized arm support on which patient's affected (paralyzed) arm is placed. This enables the patient to move his/her stroke-affected hand towards the intended (imagined) direction that aids neuroplasticity in the brain. The synchronization measure called Phase Locking Value (PLV), extracted from EEG, is the neuronal signature used to decode the directional movement of the MI task. Event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) analysis on Mu and Beta frequency bands of EEG is done to select the time bin corresponding to the MI task. The dissimilarities between the two directions of MI tasks are identified by selecting the most significant channel pairs that provided maximum difference in PLV features. The training protocol has an initial calibration session followed by a feedback session with 50 trials of MI task in each session. The feedback session extracts PLV features corresponding to most significant channel pairs which are identified in the calibration session and is used to predict the direction of MI task in left/right direction. An average MI direction classification accuracy of 74.44% is obtained in performing the training protocol and 68.63% from the prediction protocol during feedback session on 16 stroke patients.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33211662/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33211662/,English,Include,,Motor Imagery Hand Movement Direction Decoding Using Brain Computer Interface to Aid Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

However, strikingly, most of the research effort is primarily devoted to enhancing fNIRS-based BCIs for healthy individuals. The ability of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), among the main BCI end-users to utilize fNIRS-based hemodynamic responses to efficiently control an MI-based BCI, has not yet been explored. This study aims to quantify subject-specific spatio-temporal characteristics of ALS patients' hemodynamic responses to MI tasks, and to investigate the feasibility of using these responses as a means of communication to control a binary BCI. Hemodynamic responses were recorded using fNIRS from eight patients with ALS while performing MI-Rest tasks. The generalized linear model (GLM) analysis was conducted to statistically estimate and evaluate individualized spatial activation. Selected channel sets were statistically optimized for classification. Subject-specific discriminative features, including a proposed data-driven estimated coefficient obtained from GLM, and optimized classification parameters were identified and used to further evaluate the performance using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Inter-subject variations were observed in spatio-temporal characteristics of patients' hemodynamic responses. Using optimized classification parameters and feature sets, all subjects could successfully use their MI hemodynamic responses to control a BCI with an average classification accuracy of 85.4% ± 9.8%.

Functional connectivity was estimated using pairwise Pearson's correlation from the EEG of 48 subjects performing left or right hand motor imagery (MI) tasks. The classification accuracy of linear support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish both tasks were used to represent MI-BCI performance. The significant differences in connectivity strengths were examined using Welch's T-test. The association between accuracy and connection strength was studied using correlation model. Three intralobular and fourteen interlobular connections from the parietal lobe showed a correlation of 0.31 and -0.34 respectively. Results indicate that alpha wave connectivity from 8 Hz to 13 Hz was more related to classification performance compared to high-frequency waves. Subject-independent trial-based analysis shows that MI trials executed with stronger intralobular and interlobular parietal connections performed significantly better than trials with weaker connections.

However, these applications require strong and discriminant neural patterns for which extensive experience in MI may be necessary. Inspired by the field of rehabilitation where embodiment is a key element for improving cortical activity, our study proposes a novel control scheme in which virtually embodiable feedback is provided during control to enhance performance. Subjects underwent two immersive virtual reality control scenarios in which they controlled the two-dimensional movement of a device using electroencephalography (EEG). The two scenarios only differ on whether embodiable feedback, which mirrors the movement of the classified intention, is provided. After undergoing each scenario, subjects also answered a questionnaire in which they rated how immersive the scenario and embodiable the feedback were. Subjects exhibited higher control performance, greater discriminability in brain activity patterns, and enhanced cortical activation when using our control scheme compared to the standard control scheme in which embodiable feedback is absent. Moreover, the self-rated embodiment and presence scores showed significantly positive linear relationships with performance. The findings in our study provide evidence that providing embodiable feedback as guidance on how intention is classified may be effective for control applications by inducing enhanced neural activity and patterns with greater discriminability.

However, EEG signals come from multiple electrodes, the data of which can generate multiple features. How to select electrodes and features to improve classification performance has become an urgent problem to be solved. This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) structure with separated temporal and spatial filters, which selects the raw EEG signals of the electrode pairs over the motor cortex region as hybrid samples without any preprocessing or artificial feature extraction operations. In the proposed structure, a 5-layer CNN has been applied to learn EEG features, a 4-layer max pooling has been used to reduce dimensionality, and a fully-connected (FC) layer has been utilized for classification.

Bedside detection of covert awareness employing motor imagery tasks (MI), which is a universally accepted clinical indicator of awareness in the absence of overt behavior, may miss some of these patients, as they could still have a certain level of awareness. We aimed at assessing covert awareness in patients with UWS using a visuomotor-guided motor imagery task (VMI) during EEG recording. nine patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS), 11 patients in a UWS, and 15 healthy individuals (control group-CG) were provided with an VMI (imagine dancing while watching a group dance video to command), a simple-MI (imagine squeezing their right hand to command), and an advanced-MI (imagine dancing without watching a group dance video to command) to detect command-following. We analyzed the command-specific EEG responses (event-related synchronization/desynchronization-ERS/ERD) of each patient, assessing whether these responses were appropriate, consistent, and statistically similar to those elicited in the CG, as reliable markers of motor imagery. All patients in MCS, all healthy individuals and one patient in UWS repeatedly and reliably generated appropriate EEG responses to distinct commands of motor imagery with a classification accuracy of 60-80%. VMI outperformed significantly MI tasks. Therefore, patients in UWS may be still misdiagnosed despite a rigorous clinical assessment and an appropriate MI assessment. It is thus possible to suggest that motor imagery tasks should be delivered to patients with chronic disorders of consciousness in visuomotor-aided modality (also in the rehabilitation setting) to greatly entrain patient's participation. In this regard, the EEG approach we described has the clear advantage of being cheap, portable, widely available, and objective.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to establish a four-class MI BCI system, in which the four types are the four articulations within the right upper limbs, involving the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand. Ten subjects were chosen to perform nine upper-limb analytic movements, after which the differences were compared in P300, movement-related potentials(MRPS), and event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization under voluntary MI (V-MI) and involuntary MI (INV-MI). Next, the cross-frequency coupling (CFC) coefficient based on mutual information was extracted from the electrodes and frequency bands with interest. Combined with the image Fourier transform and twin bounded support vector machine classifier, four kinds of electroencephalography data were classified, and the classifier's parameters were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The results were shown to be encouraging, with an average accuracy of 93.2% and 92.2% for V-MI and INV-MI, respectively, and over 95% for any three classes and any two classes. In most cases, the accuracy of feature extraction using the proximal articulations as the basis was found to be relatively high and had better performance.

By applying multiclass CSP, the classification accuracies were improved (Mean SD: 40.6 ± 10.1%) compared with classical CSP (21.8 ± 2.5%) and no spatial filtering case (38.7±10.0%). In addition, we visualized learned spatial filters to assess the trend of discriminative features of finger motions.

There have been many efforts to develop BCI using MEG with high accuracy, though an increase in the number of channels (NoC) means an increase in computational complexity. However, not all sensors necessarily contribute significantly to an increase in classification accuracy (CA) and specifically in the case of MEG-based BCI no channel selection methodology has been performed. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of channel selection on the performance of MEG-based BCI. MEG data were recorded for two sessions from 15 healthy participants performing motor imagery, cognitive imagery and a mixed imagery task pair using a unique paradigm. Performance of four state-of-the-art channel selection methods (i.e. Class-Correlation, ReliefF, Random Forest, and Infinite Latent Feature Selection were applied across six binary tasks in three different frequency bands) were evaluated in this study on two state-of-the-art features, i.e. bandpower and common spatial pattern (CSP). All four methods provided a statistically significant increase in CA compared to a baseline method using all gradiometer sensors, i.e. 204 channels with band-power features from alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), or broadband (α + β) (8-30 Hz). It is also observed that the alpha frequency band performed better than the beta and broadband frequency bands. The performance of the beta band gave the lowest CA compared with the other two bands. Channel selection improved accuracy irrespective of feature types. Moreover, all the methods reduced the NoC significantly, from 204 to a range of 1-25, using bandpower as a feature and from 15 to 105 for CSP. The optimal channel number also varied not only in each session but also for each participant. Reducing the NoC will help to decrease the computational cost and maintain numerical stability in cases of low trial numbers.

The traditional methods for discriminative feature extraction, such as common spatial pattern (CSP) and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP), have only focused on the energy features of the electroencephalography (EEG) and thus ignored the further exploration of temporal information. However, the temporal information of spatially filtered EEG may be critical to the performance improvement of MI decoding. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach termed filter-bank spatial filtering and temporal-spatial convolutional neural network (FBSF-TSCNN) for MI decoding, where the FBSF block transforms the raw EEG signals into an appropriate intermediate EEG presentation, and then the TSCNN block decodes the intermediate EEG signals. Moreover, a novel stage-wise training strategy is proposed to mitigate the difficult optimization problem of the TSCNN block in the case of insufficient training samples.

SEEG, however, requires long hospitalizations to record seizures, and ictal interpretation can be incomplete or inaccurate. Our recent work showed that non-directed resting-state analyses may identify brain regions as epileptogenic or uninvolved. Our present objective is to map epileptogenic networks in greater detail and more accurately identify seizure-onset regions using directed resting-state SEEG connectivity. In 25 patients with focal epilepsy who underwent SEEG, 2 minutes of resting-state, artifact-free, SEEG data were selected and functional connectivity was estimated. Using standard clinical interpretation, brain regions were classified into four categories: ictogenic, early propagation, irritative, or uninvolved. Three non-directed connectivity measures (mutual information [MI] strength, and imaginary coherence between and within regions) and four directed measures (partial directed coherence [PDC] and directed transfer function [DTF], inward and outward strength) were calculated. Logistic regression was used to generate a predictive model of ictogenicity. Ictogenic regions had the highest and uninvolved regions had the lowest MI strength. Although both PDC and DTF inward strengths were highest in ictogenic regions, outward strengths did not differ among categories. A model incorporating directed and nondirected connectivity measures demonstrated an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.88 in predicting ictogenicity of individual regions. The AUC of this model was 0.93 when restricted to patients with favorable postsurgical seizure outcomes. Directed connectivity measures may help identify epileptogenic networks without requiring ictal recordings.

The goal of this work is to frame these as a unified challenge and reconsider how transfer learning is used to overcome these difficulties. We present two variations of a holistic approach to transfer learning with DNNs for BCI that rely on a deeper network called TIDNet. Our approaches use multiple subjects for training in the interest of creating a more universal classifier that is applicable for new (unseen) subjects. The first approach is purely subject-invariant and the second targets specific subjects, without loss of generality. We use five publicly accessible datasets covering a range of tasks and compare our approaches to state-of-the-art alternatives in detail. We observe that TIDNet in conjunction with our training augmentations is more consistent when compared to shallower baselines, and in some cases exhibits large and significant improvements, for instance motor imagery classification improvements of over 8%. Furthermore, we show that our suggested multi-domain learning (MDL) strategy strongly outperforms simply fine-tuned general models when targeting specific subjects, while remaining more generalizable to still unseen subjects. TIDNet in combination with a data alignment-based training augmentation proves to be a consistent classification approach of single raw trials and can be trained even with the inclusion of corrupted trials. Our MDL strategy calls into question the intuition to fine-tune trained classifiers to new subjects, as it proves simpler and more accurate while remaining general. Furthermore, we show evidence that augmented TIDNet training makes better use of additional subjects, showing continued and greater performance improvement over shallower alternatives, indicating promise for a new subject-invariant paradigm rather than a subject-specific one.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32916675/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32916675/,English,Include,,Thinker invariance: enabling deep neural networks for BCI across more people.,Exclude,No performance metrics reported,No metrics found in full text,,0.9,0.6,

To solve this problem, many temporal and spatial feature based channel selection methods have been proposed. However, temporal and spatial features do not accurately reflect changes in the power of the oscillatory EEG. Thus, spectral features of MI-related EEG signals may be useful for channel selection. Bispectrum analysis is a technique developed for extracting non-linear and non-Gaussian information from non-linear and non-Gaussian signals. The features extracted from bispectrum analysis can provide frequency domain information about the EEG. Therefore, in this study, we propose a bispectrum-based channel selection (BCS) method for MI-based BCI. The proposed method uses the sum of logarithmic amplitudes (SLA) and the first order spectral moment (FOSM) features extracted from bispectrum analysis to select EEG channels without redundant information.

The reliability of MMI systems is highly dependent on the identification of various motor imagery (MI) tasks. Perfect discrimination of brain activities is required to avoid miscommunication. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide a scrupulous solution for the development of MMI. Analysis of multi-channel EEG signals increases the burden of computation drastically. The extraction of hidden information from raw EEG signals is difficult due to its complex nature. A signal is needed to be decomposed and classified for the extraction of hidden information from it. But selecting the uniform decomposition and hyperparameters for decomposition and classification of the signal can lead to information loss and misclassification. This paper presents a novel method for identifying right-hand and right-foot MI tasks. The method employs a single-channel adaptive decomposition and EEG signal classification. The multi-cluster unsupervised learning method is employed for the selection of significant channel. Further, flexible variational mode decomposition (F-VMD) is used for the adaptive decomposition of signals. The values of decomposition parameters are selected adaptively following the nature of EEG signals. The value of decomposition parameters is used to decompose the signals into narrow-band modes. Hjorth, entropy and quartile based features are elicited from the modes of F-VMD. These features are classified by using a flexible extreme learning machine (F-ELM). F-ELM selects the hyperparameters and kernel adaptively by reducing the classification error. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated by measuring five performance parameters namely accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC), and F-1 score. An ACC, SEN, SPE, MCC and F-1 score is obtained as 100%, 100%, 100%, 100%, and 1. The performance parameters obtained by the proposed method prove the superiority over other methodologies using the same data-set.

Although a lot of research works have been proposed to improve CSP, most of these works have the problems of large computation costs and long feature extraction time. To this end, three new feature extraction methods based on CSP and a new feature selection method based on non-convex log regularization are proposed in this paper. Firstly, EEG signals are spatially filtered by CSP, and then three new feature extraction methods are proposed. We called them CSP-wavelet, CSP-WPD and CSP-FB, respectively. For CSP-Wavelet and CSP-WPD, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) or wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is used to decompose the spatially filtered signals, and then the energy and standard deviation of the wavelet coefficients are extracted as features. For CSP-FB, the spatially filtered signals are filtered into multiple bands by a filter bank (FB), and then the logarithm of variances of each band are extracted as features. Secondly, a sparse optimization method regularized with a non-convex log function is proposed for the feature selection, which we called LOG, and an optimization algorithm for LOG is given. Finally, ensemble learning is used for secondary feature selection and classification model construction. Combing feature extraction and feature selection methods, a total of three new EEG decoding methods are obtained, namely CSP-Wavelet+LOG, CSP-WPD+LOG, and CSP-FB+LOG. Four public motor imagery datasets are used to verify the performance of the proposed methods.

Due to the strict requirements for subjects and experimental environments, it is difficult to collect large-scale and high-quality electroencephalogram (EEG) data.

Based on this, we investigated the performance of different data augmentation (DA) methods for the classification of MI data using a DNN. First, we transformed the time series signals into spectrogram images using a short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Then, we evaluated and compared the performance of different DA methods for this spectrogram data. Next, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the MI signals and compared the classification performance of after DA.

This research proposes a novel feature learning approach to address the classification problem of 6-class MI tasks, including imaginary elbow flexion/extension, wrist supination/pronation, and hand close/open within the unilateral upper limb. Instead of the traditional common spatial pattern (CSP) or filter-bank CSP (FBCSP) manner, the Riemannian geometry (RG) framework involving Riemannian distance and Riemannian mean was directly adopted to extract tangent space (TS) features from spatial covariance matrices of the MI EEG trials. Subsequently, to reduce the dimensionality of the TS features, the algorithm of partial least squares regression was applied to obtain more separable and compact feature representations. The performance of the learned RG feature representations was validated by a linear discriminative analysis and support vector machine classifier, with an average accuracy of 80.50% and 79.70% on EEG dataset collected from 12 participants, respectively. These results demonstrate that compared with CSP and FBCSP features, the proposed approach can significantly increase the decoding accuracy for multiclass MI tasks from the same upper limb.

They can provide a means of communication or locomotion for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases or stroke. However, non-stationarity of brain activity limits the reliable transfer of the algorithms that were trained during a calibration session to real-time BCI control. One source of non-stationarity is the user's brain response to the BCI output (feedback), for instance, whether the BCI feedback is perceived as an error by the user or not. By taking such sources of non-stationarity into account, the reliability of the BCI can be improved. In this work, we demonstrate a real-time implementation of a hybrid motor imagery BCI combining the information from the motor imagery signal and the error-related brain activity simultaneously so as to gain benefit from both sources. We show significantly improved performance in real-time BCI control across 12 participants, compared to a conventional motor imagery BCI. The significant improvement is in terms of classification accuracy, target hit rate, subjective perception of control and information-transfer rate. Moreover, our offline analyses of the recorded EEG data show that the error-related brain activity provides a more reliable source of information than the motor imagery signal. This work shows, for the first time, that the error-related brain activity classifier compared to the motor imagery classifier is more consistent when trained on calibration data and tested during online control.

Furthermore, the features were extracted by CSP from each time segment and were combined to form a new feature vector.

Brain-signal decoding robustness and system performance improvement during the motor imagery process are two of the essential issues in brain-computer interface research. In conventional approaches, ineffective decoding of features and high complexity of algorithms often lead to unsatisfactory performance. A novel method for the recognition of motor imagery tasks is developed based on employing a modified S-transforms for spectro-temporal representation to characterize the behavior of electrocorticogram activities. A classifier is trained by using a support vector machine, and an optimized wrapper approach is applied to guide selection to implement the representation selection obtained. A channel selection algorithm optimizes the wrapper approach by adding a cross-validation step, which effectively improves the classification performance. The modified S-transform can accurately capture event-related desynchronization/event-related synchronization phenomena and can effectively locate sensorimotor rhythm information. The optimized wrapper approach used in this scheme can effectively reduce the feature dimension and improve algorithm efficiency. The method is evaluated on a public electrocorticogram dataset with a recognition accuracy of 98% and an information transfer rate of 0.8586 bit/trial.

To overcome this challenge, we propose a collaborative representation-based semi-supervised extreme learning machine (CR-SSELM) algorithm to evaluate the risk of unlabeled samples by a new safety-control mechanism. Specifically, the ELM model is firstly used to predict unlabeled samples and then the collaborative representation (CR) approach is employed to reconstruct the unlabeled samples according to the obtained prediction results, from which the risk degree of unlabeled sample is defined.

One of the major tasks associated with the BCI system is to improve classification performance of the motor imagery (MI) signal. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are widely used for the MI BCI system. The raw EEG signals are usually non-stationary time series with weak class properties, degrading the classification performance. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has been successfully applied to pattern extraction which provides meaningful data presentation. However, NMF is unsupervised and cannot make use of the label information. Based on the label information of MI EEG data, we propose a novel method, called double-constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (DCNMF), to improve the classification performance of NMF on MI BCI. The proposed method constructs a couple of label matrices as the constraints on the NMF procedure to make the EEGs with the same class labels have the similar representation in the low-dimensional space, while the EEGs with different class labels have dissimilar representations as much as possible.

This paper proposes a new deep multi-view feature learning method for the classification task of motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. In order to obtain more representative motor imagery features in EEG signals, we introduced a multi-view feature representation based on the characteristics of EEG signals and the differences between different features. Different feature extraction methods were used to respectively extract the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and spatial features of EEG signals, so as to made them cooperate and complement. Then, the deep restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) network improved by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding(t-SNE) was adopted to learn the multi-view features of EEG signals, so that the algorithm removed the feature redundancy while took into account the global characteristics in the multi-view feature sequence, reduced the dimension of the multi-visual features and enhanced the recognizability of the features. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) was chosen to classify deep multi-view features. Applying our proposed method to the BCI competition IV 2a dataset we obtained excellent classification results.

In this study, the effectiveness of subject-specific feature selection on classification accuracy of fNIRS signals is examined.

Monitoring brain activity through electroencephalography (EEG) has become an important tool in the diagnosis of brain disorders. The robust automatic classification of EEG signals is an important step towards detecting a brain disorder in its earlier stages before status deterioration. Motivated by the computation capabilities of natural evolution strategies (NES), this paper introduces an effective automatic classification approach denoted as natural evolution optimization-based deep learning (NEODL). The proposed classifier is an ingredient in a signal processing chain that comprises other state-of-the-art techniques in a consistent framework for the purpose of automatic EEG classification. The proposed framework consists of four steps. First, the L1-principal component analysis technique is used to enhance the raw EEG signal against any expected artifacts or noise. Second, the purified EEG signal is decomposed into a number of sub-bands by applying the wavelet transform technique where a number of spectral and statistical features are extracted. Third, the extracted features are examined using the artificial bee colony approach in order to optimally select the best features. Lastly, the selected features are treated using the proposed NEODL classifier, where the input signal is classified according to the problem at hand. The proposed approach is evaluated using two benchmark datasets and addresses two neurological disorder applications: epilepsy disease and motor imagery. Several experiments are conducted where the proposed classifier outperforms other deep learning techniques as well as other existing approaches. The proposed framework, including the proposed classifier (NEODL), has a promising performance in the classification of EEG signals, including epilepsy disease and motor imagery. Based on the given results, it is expected that this approach will also be useful for the identification of the epileptogenic areas in the human brain.

Then, select the data sets that were most relevant to the new data set according to Euclidean distance to update the shared features. Finally, utilize the shared features and subject/session-specific features jointly to generate a new model.

A pool of datasets of resting state and movements related EEG signals was recorded with 93 subjects during 2 sessions in separated days. Two methods, Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) and template matching, were used for SMR and MRCP feature extraction, and a winner-take-all strategy was applied to assess pattern recognition with posterior probabilities from Linear Discriminant Analysis to combine SMR and MRCP features.

Here, we examined a way to enhance mu-based BCI performance by electrically stimulating the ulnar nerve of the contralateral wrist at the alpha frequency (10 Hz) during left- and right-hand motor imagination in two BCI groups (literate and illiterate). We demonstrate that this alpha frequency intervention enhances the classification accuracy between left- and right-hand motor imagery from 66.41% to 81.57% immediately after intervention and to 75.28% two days after intervention in the BCI illiteracy group, while classification accuracy improves from 82.12% to 91.84% immediately after intervention and to 89.03% two days after intervention in the BCI literacy group. However, the classification accuracy did not change before and after the sham intervention (no electrical stimulation).

Emerging matrix classifiers have been successfully applied to motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, but they belong to shallow classifiers, making powerful stacked generalization principle not exploited for automatically learning deep EEG features. To learn the high-level representation and abstraction, we proposed a novel deep stacked support matrix machine (DSSMM) to improve the performance of existing shallow matrix classifiers in EEG classification. The main idea of our framework is founded on the stacked generalization principle, where support matrix machine (SMM) is introduced as the basic building block of deep stacked network. The weak predictions of all previous layers obtained via SMM are randomly projected to help move apart the manifold of the original input EEG feature, and then the newly generated features are fed into the next layer of DSSMM. The framework only involves an efficient feed-forward rather than parameter fine-tuning with backpropagation, each layer of which is a convex optimization problem, thus simplifying the objective function solving process. Extensive experiments on three public EEG datasets and a self-collected EEG dataset are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate that our DSSMM outperforms the available state-of-the-art methods. The proposed DSSMM inherits the characteristic of matrix classifiers that can learn the structural information of data as well as the powerful capability of deep representation learning, which makes it adapted to classify complex matrix-form EEG data.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283388/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283388/,English,Include,,Deep stacked support matrix machine based representation learning for motor imagery EEG classification.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (EEG) classification is a widely applied paradigm in brain-computer interfaces. The common spatial pattern, based on the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon, is one of the most popular algorithms for motor imagery-based EEG classification. Moreover, the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature based on the event-related potential phenomenon has been demonstrated to provide complementary information to ERD/ERS-based features. In this paper, aiming to improve the performance of motor imagery-based EEG classification in a few-channel situation, an ensemble support vector learning (ESVL)-based approach is proposed to combine the advantages of the ERD/ERS-based features and the event-related potential-based features in motor imagery-based EEG classification. ESVL is an ensemble learning algorithm based on support vector machine classifier. Specifically, the decision boundary with the largest interclass margin is obtained using the support vector machine algorithm, and the distances between sample points and the decision boundary are mapped to posterior probabilities. The probabilities obtained from different support vector machine classifiers are combined to make prediction. Thus, ESVL leverages the advantages of multiple trained support vector machine classifiers and makes a better prediction based on the posterior probabilities. The class discrepancy-guided sub-band-based common spatial pattern and the spatiotemporal discrepancy feature are applied to extract discriminative features, and then, the extracted features are used to train the ESVL classifier and make predictions. The BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ESVL algorithm. Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods are performed, and the proposed ESVL-based approach achieves an average max kappa value of 0.60 and 0.71 on BCI Competition IV datasets 2a and 2b respectively. The results show that the proposed ESVL-based approach improves the performance of motor imagery-based brain-computer interfaces. The proposed ESVL classifier could use the posterior probabilities to realize ensemble learning and the ESVL-based motor imagery classification approach takes advantage of the merits of ERD/ERS based feature and event-related potential based feature to improve the experimental performance.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283387/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32283387/,English,Include,,Motor imagery EEG classification based on ensemble support vector learning.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

Raw signals were gathered from 64-channel scalp electroencephalograms of 11 healthy participants. Firstly, the cortical source model was defined with 62 regions of interest over the sensorimotor cortex (nine Brodmann areas). Secondly, functional connectivity was calculated by phase lock value for α and β rhythm networks. Thirdly, network-based statistics were applied to identify whether there existed stable and significant subnetworks that formed between the two types of motor imagery tasks. Meanwhile, ten graph theory indices were investigated for each network by t-test to determine statistical significance between tasks. Finally, sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR)-support vector machine (SVM), as a feature selection and classification model, was used to analyze the graph theory features. The specific time-frequency (α event-related desynchronization and β event-related synchronization) difference network between the two tasks was congregated at the midline and demonstrated significant connections in the premotor areas and primary somatosensory cortex. A few of statistically significant differences in the network properties were observed between tasks in the α and β rhythm. The SMLR-SVM classification model achieved fair discrimination accuracy between imaginary movements of the two feet (maximum 75% accuracy rate in single-trial analyses).

However, its effectiveness depends heavily on the choice of frequency bands, and Euclidean space cannot effectively describe the inner relationship. To solve these problems, a classification approach for motor imagery using the Geodesic Filtering Common Spatial Pattern (GFCSP) and filter-bank Feature Weighted Support Vector Machine (FWSVM) is presented. First, GFCSP based on the Riemannian manifold is proposed, in which the extracted covariance features are spatially filtered in Riemannian tangent space, and the average covariance matrix is replaced by Riemannian mean in CSP. Second, filter-bank FWSVM with a feature weighted matrix is proposed. EEG signals are filtered into 8-12 Hz, 12-16 Hz, 18-22 Hz, 22-26 Hz, and a wide band of 8-24 Hz, and GFCSP features of these filtered signals are extracted. A feature weighted matrix is calculated using mutual information and the Pearson correlation coefficient from these features and class information.

The group of channels, localized in space and frequency, are then processed with spatial filter, and features are subsequently extracted for classification task. Experimental results corroborate that the proposed space localization helps to increase the classification accuracy when compared to the existing methods using spatial filters.

In this paper, a novel active learning method is proposed to minimize the amount of labeled, subject-specific EEG data required for effective classifier training, by combining measures of uncertainty and representativeness within an extreme learning machine (ELM). Following this approach, an ELM classifier was first used to select a relatively large batch of unlabeled examples, whose uncertainty was measured through the best-versus-second-best (BvSB) strategy. The diversity of each sample was then measured between the limited labeled training data and previously selected unlabeled samples, and similarity is measured among the previously selected samples. Finally, a tradeoff parameter is introduced to control the balance between informative and representative samples, and these samples are then used to construct a powerful ELM classifier. Extensive experiments were conducted using benchmark and multiclass motor imagery EEG datasets to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method.

This paper presents a novel integration of covariate shift estimation and unsupervised adaptive ensemble learning (CSE-UAEL) to tackle non-stationarity in motor-imagery (MI) related EEG classification.

Model trained on source subjects is transferred to work for target subjects, in which the critical problem to handle is the distribution shift. It is found that the performance of classification would be bad when only the marginal distributions of source and target are made closer, since the discriminative directions of the source and target domains may still be much different.

Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for ""mental communication"" on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for ""yes"" and to stay relaxed for ""no."" The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as ""yes"" or ""no"" responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32132894/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32132894/,English,Include,,Assessing Time-Resolved fNIRS for Brain-Computer Interface Applications of Mental Communication.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.45,cv_reported;small_sample_mentioned

The reliability of a BCI system confides on the efficiency of the assessment of different MI tasks. The present work proposes a new approach for the classification of distinct MI tasks based on EEG signals using the flexible analytic wavelet transform (FAWT) technique. The FAWT decomposes the EEG signal into sub-bands and temporal moment-based features are extracted from the sub-bands. Feature normalization is applied to minimize the bias nature of classifier.

One common BCI paradigm is motor imagery in which the user controls a BCI by imagining movements of different body parts. It is known that imagining different body parts results in event-related desynchronization (ERD) in various frequency bands. Existing methods such as common spatial patterns (CSP) and its refinement filterbank common spatial patterns (FB-CSP) aim at finding features that are informative for classification of the motor imagery class. Our proposed method is a temporally adaptive common spatial patterns implementation of the commonly used filter-bank common spatial patterns method using convolutional neural networks; hence it is called TA-CSPNN. With this method we aim to: (1) make the feature extraction and classification end-to-end, (2) base it on the way CSP/FBCSP extracts relevant features, and finally, (3) reduce the number of trainable parameters compared to existing deep learning methods to improve generalizability in noisy data such as EEG.

However, CSP is computed using sample-based covariance-matrix estimation. Hence, its performance deteriorates if the number of training trials is small. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel regularized covariance matrix estimation framework for CSP (i.e. DTW-RCSP) based on dynamic time warping (DTW) and transfer learning. The proposed framework combines the subject-specific covariance matrix ([Formula: see text]) estimated using the available trials from the new subject, with a novel DTW-based transferred covariance matrix ([Formula: see text]) estimated using previous subjects' trials. In the proposed [Formula: see text], the available labelled trials from the previous subjects are temporally aligned to the average of the available trials of the new subject from the same class using DTW. This alignment aims to reduce temporal variations and non-stationarities between previous subjects' trials and the available trials from the new subjects. Moreover, to tackle the problem of regularization parameter selection when only a few trials are available for training, an online method is proposed, where the best regularization parameter is selected based on the confidence scores of the trained classifier on the upcoming first few labelled testing trials. The proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets against two baseline algorithms. The obtained results reveal that DTW-RCSP significantly outperformed the baseline algorithms at various testing scenarios, particularly, when only a few trials are available for training.

It has been increasingly used in neuroscience because of its ability to detect unknown non-linear interactions, which makes it well suited for exploratory brain effective connectivity analyses. Like all information theoretic quantities, TE is defined regarding the probability distributions of the system under study, which in practice are unknown and must be estimated from data. Commonly used methods for TE estimation rely on a local approximation of the probability distributions from nearest neighbor distances, or on symbolization schemes that then allow the probabilities to be estimated from the symbols' relative frequencies. However, probability estimation is a challenging problem, and avoiding this intermediate step in TE computation is desirable. In this work, we propose a novel TE estimator using functionals defined on positive definite and infinitely divisible kernels matrices that approximate Renyi's entropy measures of order α. Our data-driven approach estimates TE directly from data, sidestepping the need for probability distribution estimation. Also, the proposed estimator encompasses the well-known definition of TE as a sum of Shannon entropies in the limiting case when α → 1. We tested our proposal on a simulation framework consisting of two linear models, based on autoregressive approaches and a linear coupling function, respectively, and on the public electroencephalogram (EEG) database BCI Competition IV, obtained under a motor imagery paradigm. For the synthetic data, the proposed kernel-based TE estimation method satisfactorily identifies the causal interactions present in the data. Also, it displays robustness to varying noise levels and data sizes, and to the presence of multiple interaction delays in the same connected network.

However, it was not used to classify the left versus right foot KMI, due to its location inside the mesial wall of sensorimotor cortex, which makes it difficult to be detected. We report novel classification of mu and beta EEG features, during left and right foot KMI cognitive task, using CSP, and filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) method, to optimize the subject-specific band selection. We initially proposed CSP method, followed by the implementation of FBCSP for optimization of individual spatial patterns, wherein a set of CSP filters was learned, for each of the time/frequency filters in a supervised way. This was followed by the log-variance feature extraction and concatenation of all features (over all chosen spectral-filters). Subsequently, supervised machine learning was implemented, i.e. logistic regression (Logreg) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), in order to compare the respective foot KMI classification rates. Training and testing data, used in the model, was validated using 10-fold cross validation. Four methodology paradigms are reported, i.e. CSP LDA, CSP Logreg, and FBCSP LDA, FBCSP Logreg. All paradigms resulted in an average classification accuracy rate above the statistical chance level of 60.0% (P < 0.01). On average, FBCSP LDA outperformed remaining paradigms with kappa score of 0.41 and classification accuracy of 70.28% ± 4.23. Similarly, this paradigm enabled discrimination between right and left foot KMI cognitive task at highest accuracy rate i.e. maximum 77.5% with kappa = 0.55 and the area under ROC curve as 0.70 (in single-trial analysis).

Using the concept of SPM, we developed a novel technique for quantification of the statistical deviation of an intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) measure from the nonepileptic mean. We validated this technique using data previously collected from 123 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy who underwent resective epilepsy surgery. We determined how the measurement of statistical deviation of modulation index (MI) from the non-epileptic mean (rated by z-score) improved the performance of seizure outcome classification model solely based on conventional clinical, seizure onset zone (SOZ), and neuroimaging variables. Here, MI is a summary measure quantifying the strength of in-situ coupling between high-frequency activity at >150 Hz and slow wave at 3-4 Hz. We initially generated a normative MI atlas showing the mean and standard deviation of slow-wave sleep MI of neighboring non-epileptic channels of 47 patients, whose ECoG sampling involved all four lobes. We then calculated 'MI z-score' at each electrode site. SOZ had a greater 'MI z-score' compared to non-SOZ in the remaining 76 patients. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic analysis to the combined data of all patients revealed that the full regression model incorporating all predictor variables, including SOZ and 'MI z-score', best classified the seizure outcome with sensitivity/specificity of 0.86/0.76. The model excluding 'MI z-score' worsened its sensitivity/specificity to 0.86/0.48. Furthermore, the leave-one-out analysis successfully cross-validated the full regression model.

The main aims of the proposed work are: (i) to reduce the computational complexity of the BCI systems during MI detection by selecting the relevant EEG channels, (ii) to reduce the amount of data overfitting that may arise due to unnecessary channels and redundant features, and (iii) to reduce the classification time for real-time BCI applications. The proposed method selects subject-specific EEG channels and features based on their MI. In this work, we make use of non-negative matrix factorization to extract the weight of the EEG channels based on their contribution to MI detection. Further, the neighborhood component analysis is used for subject-specific feature selection. We executed the experiments using EEG signals recorded for MI where ten healthy subjects performed MI movement of the lower limb to generate motor commands.

To achieve this goal, an important system requirement is asynchronous control, whereby users can initiate intentional brain activation in a self-paced rather than system-cued manner. However, to date, asynchronous BCIs have been explored in a minority of BCI studies and their performance is generally below that of system-paced alternatives. In this paper, we present an asynchronous electroencephalography (EEG) BCI that detects a non-motor imagery cognitive task and investigated the possibility of improving its performance using error-related potentials (ErrP). Ten able-bodied adults attended two sessions of data collection each, one for training and one for testing the BCI. The visual interface consisted of a centrally located cartoon icon. For each participant, an asynchronous BCI differentiated among the idle state and a personally selected cognitive task (mental arithmetic, word generation or figure rotation). The BCI continuously analyzed the EEG data stream and displayed real-time feedback (i.e. icon fell over) upon detection of brain activity indicative of a cognitive task. The BCI also monitored the EEG signals for the presence of error-related potentials following the presentation of feedback. An ErrP classifier was invoked to automatically alter the task classifier outcome when an error-related potential was detected.

The objective of this study was to develop a simple yet effective method of feature selection to improve the accuracy of a subject independent BCI algorithm and streamline the process of BCI algorithm development. Over the past several years, several high precision features have been suggested by researchers to classify different motor imagery tasks. This research applies fourteen of these features as a feature pool that can be used as a reference for future researchers. Additionally, we look for the most efficient feature or feature set with four different classifiers that best differentiates several motor imagery tasks. In this work we have successfully employed a feature fusion method to obtain the best sub-set of features. We have proposed a novel computer aided feature selection method to determine the best set of features for distinguishing between motor imagery tasks in lieu of the manual feature selection that has been performed in past studies. The features selected by this method were then fed into a Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, or support vector machine classifier for classification to determine the overall performance. The methods used were a novel performance based additive feature fusion algorithm working in conjunction with machine learning in order to classify the motor imagery signals into particular states. The data used for this study was collected from BCI competition III dataset IVa. The result of this algorithm was a classification accuracy of 99% for a subject independent algorithm with less computation cost compared to traditional methods, in addition to multiple feature/classifier combinations that outperform current subject independent methods. The conclusion of this study and its significance is that it developed a viable methodology for simple, efficient feature selection and BCI algorithm development, which leads to an overall increase in algorithm classification accuracy.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428313/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31428313/,English,Include,,A performance based feature selection technique for subject independent MI based BCI.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

BCI based on functional substitution enables the recognition of a subject's intention to control devices such as prosthesis and wheelchairs. Discrimination of electroencephalography (EEG) trials related to left- and right-hand movements requires complex EEG signal processing to achieve good system performance. In this study, a novel dynamic and self-adaptive algorithm (DSAA) based on the least-squares method is proposed to select the most appropriate feature extraction and classification algorithms couple for each subject. Specifically, the best couple identified during the training of the system is updated during online testing in order to check the stability of the selected couple and maintain high system accuracy. Extensive and systematic experiments were conducted on public datasets of 17 subjects in the BCI-competition and the results show an improved performance for DSAA over other selected state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed system enhanced the classification accuracy for the three chosen public datasets by 8% compared to other approaches. Moreover, the proposed system was successful in selecting the best path despite the unavailability of reference labels. Performing dynamic and self-adaptive selection for the best feature extraction and classification algorithm couple increases the recognition rate of trials despite the unavailability of reference trial labels.

Also, we developed a real-time health 4.0 (H4.0) architecture for brain-controlled internet of things (IoT) enabled environments (BCE), which uses the classified MI task to assist disabled persons in controlling IoT-enabled environments such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). The first method for classification involves a simple and low-complex classification framework using a combination of regularized Riemannian mean (RRM) and linear SVM. Although this method performs better compared to state-of-the-art techniques, it still suffers from a nonnegligible misclassification rate. Hence, to overcome this, the second method offers a persistent decision engine (PDE) for the MI classification, which improves classification accuracy (CA) significantly. The proposed methods are validated using an in-house recorded four-class MI data set (data set I, collected over 14 subjects), and a four-class MI data set 2a of BCI competition IV (data set II, collected over 9 subjects). The proposed RRM architecture obtained average CAs of 74.30% and 67.60% when validated using datasets I and II, respectively. When analyzed along with the proposed PDE classification framework, an average CA of 92.25% on 12 subjects of data set I and 82.54% on 7 subjects of data set II is obtained. The results show that the PDE algorithm is more reliable for the classification of four-class MI and is also feasible for BCE applications. The proposed low-complex BCE architecture is implemented in real time using Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ along with the Virgo EEG data acquisition system.

Motor imagery (MI) has been used in many studies as a control signal for BCIs. However, MI may not be suitable for all control purposes, and several people cannot obtain BCI control with MI. In this study, the aim was to investigate the feasibility of decoding covert speech from single-trial EEG and compare and combine it with MI. In seven healthy subjects, EEG was recorded with twenty-five channels during six different actions: Speaking three words (both covert and overt speech), two arm movements (both motor imagery and execution), and one idle class.

Moreover, instead of using LSTM directly for classification, we use regression based output of the LSTM network as one of the features for classification. On the other hand, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the CSP variance based features. The features in the reduced dimensional plane after performing LDA are used as input to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier together with the regression based feature obtained from the LSTM network.

This study presents a proposal, based on a hierarchical structured system, for recognising intentional and non-intentional mental tasks on a BCI system by applying machine learning techniques to the EEG signals. First-level clustering is performed to distinguish between intentional control (IC) and non-intentional control (NC) state patterns. Then, the patterns recognised as IC are passed on to a second stage where supervised learning techniques are used to classify them.

As a nonlinear dimension reduction method, landmark maximum variance unfolding (L-MVU) can completely retain the nonlinear features of MI-EEG. However, L-MVU still requires considerable computation costs for out-of-sample data. An incremental version of L-MVU (denoted as IL-MVU) is proposed in this paper.

For each out-of-sample data, its nearest neighbors will be found in the high-dimensional training samples and the corresponding reconstruction weight matrix be calculated to generate its low-dimensional representation as well. IL-MVU is further combined with the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which develops a hybrid feature extraction method (named as IL-MD).

The principle of hybridization stands for combining at least two different BCI modalities into a single interface with the aim of improving the information transfer rate by increasing the recognition accuracy and number of choices available for the user. This study proposes a simultaneous hybrid BCI system that recognizes the motor imagery (MI) and the steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) using the EEG signals from a dual-channel EEG setting with sensors placed over the central area (C3 and C4 channels). The data processing implements a supervised optimization algorithm for the feature extraction, named the common frequency pattern, which finds the optimal spectral filter that maximizes the separability of the data by classes. The experiment compares the classification accuracy in a two-class task using the MI, SSVEP and hybrid approaches on seventeen healthy 18-29 years old subjects with various dual-channel setups and complete set of thirty EEG electrodes. The designed system reaches a high accuracy of 97.4 ± 1.1% in the hybrid task using the C3-C4 channel configuration, which is marginally lower than the 98.8 ± 0.5% accuracy achieved with the complete set of channels while applying the support vector classifier; in the plain SSVEP task the accuracy drops from 91.3 ± 3.9% to 86.0 ± 2.5% while moving from the occipital to central area under the dual-channel condition. The results demonstrate that by combining the principles of hybridization and data-driven spectral filtering for the feature selection it is feasible to compensate a lack of spatial information and implement the proposed BCI using a portable few channel EEG device even under sub-optimal conditions for the sensors placement.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31180893/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31180893/,English,Include,,Enhancing the Hybrid BCI Performance With the Common Frequency Pattern in Dual-Channel EEG.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

To address this challenge, we conducted offline analyses and online experiments to test whether the classification of different types of motor imagery could be improved when the training of the classifier was performed on the data obtained with the assistive muscular stimulation below the motor threshold. 10 healthy participants underwent three different types of experimental conditions: a) Motor imagery (MI) of hands and feet b) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation (STM) of hands and feet while resting and c) sensory threshold neuromuscular electrical stimulation during performance of motor imagery (BOTH). Also, another group of 10 participants underwent conditions a) and c). Then, online experiments with 15 users were performed.

Therefore, EEG-based motor imagery classification has received increasing attention in the fields of neuroscience. The common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm has recently achieved great success in motor imagery classification. However, varying discriminative frequency bands and few-channel EEG limit the performance of CSP. A class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter-based CSP (CDFCSP) algorithm is proposed to automatically recognize and augment the discriminative frequency bands for CSP algorithms. Specifically, a priori knowledge and templates obtained from the training set were applied as the design guidelines of the class discrepancy-guided sub-band filter (CDF). Second, a filter bank CSP was used to extract features from EEG traces filtered by the CDF. Finally, the CSP features of multiple frequency bands were leveraged to train linear support vector machine classifier and generate prediction. BCI competition IV datasets 2a and 2b, which include EEGs from 18 subjects, were used to validate the performance improvement provided by the CDF. Student's t-tests of the CDFCSP versus the filter bank CSP without the CDF showed that the performance improvement was significant (i.e., p-values of 0.040 and 0.032 for the ratio and normalization mode CDFCSP, respectively).

The analysis was performed in two online datasets: (1) a classical benchmark-the BCI competition IV dataset 2a-allowing a comparison with a representative set of strategies previously employed in this BCI paradigm and (2) a statistically representative dataset for signal processing technique comparisons over 52 subjects. Besides exploring three classical similarity measures-Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, and mean phase coherence-this work also proposes a recurrence-based alternative for estimating EEG brain functional connectivity, which takes into account the recurrence density between pairwise electrodes over a time window. These strategies were followed by graph feature evaluation considering clustering coefficient, degree, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The features were selected by Fisher's discriminating ratio and classification was performed by a least squares classifier in agreement with classical and online BCI processing strategies. The results revealed that the recurrence-based approach for functional connectivity evaluation was significantly better than the other frameworks, which is probably associated with the use of higher order statistics underlying the electrode joint probability estimation and a higher capability of capturing nonlinear inter-relations. There were no significant differences in performance among the evaluated graph features, but the eigenvector centrality was the best feature regarding processing time.

Also, multivariate entropy-based feature extraction methods have been gradually applied to analyze complex multichannel biomedical signals, such as EEG and electromyography. Compared with traditional multivariate entropies, refined composite multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (RCmvMFE) overcomes the defect of unstable entropy values caused by the scale factor increase and is beneficial towards obtaining richer feature information. However, the coarse-grained process of RCmvMFE is mean filtered, which weakens Gaussian noise and is powerless against random impulse noise interference. This yields poor quality feature information and low accuracy classification. In this paper, RCmvMFE is improved (IRCmvMFE) by using composite filters in the coarse-grained procedure to enhance filter performance. Median filters are employed to remove the impulse noise interference from multichannel MI-EEG signals, and these filtered MI-EEGs are further smoothed by the mean filters. The multiscale IRCmvMFEs are calculated for all channels of composite filtered MI-EEGs, forming a feature vector, and a support vector machine is used for pattern classification.

The first one scales the observations in such a way that implicitly normalizes the common temporal strength of the source activities. When the scaling applies independently to the trials of the observations, the procedure justifies and improves the classical preprocessing for the EEG data. In addition, when the scaling is instantaneous and independent for each sample, the procedure particularizes to Tyler's method in statistics for obtaining a distribution-free estimate of scattering. In this case, the proposal provides an original interpretation of this existing method as a technique that pursuits an implicit instantaneous power-normalization of the underlying source processes.

Power spectral density function was used to display existence of theta band in frequency domain. To analyze theta, alpha and beta rhythms of the epochs individually and together, we filtered them to their interval range with Butterworth bandpass infinite filter before feature extraction and classification stages. Then, principal component analysis and Hjorth parameters were chosen to extract efficient features in the study aiming to investigate the effect of theta brainwaves on finger movement detection. According to classification accuracies using support vector machine classifier, alpha, beta, theta rhythms and also their different combinations were compared with each other. The performance of the epochs including alpha, beta and theta rhythms were the best and they were classified ~2% to 4% higher value in accuracy than the signals including only alpha and beta rhythms. According to this, it has proved that theta brainwave takes a role and makes contribution to motor activity.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814845/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30814845/,English,Include,,Investigation of Theta Rhythm Effect in Detection of Finger Movement.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.8,small_sample_mentioned

However, due to the high dimensions and subject-specific behaviour of EEG features, there is a need for a suitable feature selection algorithm that can select the optimal features to give the best classification performance along with increased computational efficiency. The present study proposes a feature selection algorithm based on neighbourhood component analysis (NCA) with modification of the regularization parameter. In the experiment, time, frequency, and phase features of the EEG are extracted using a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT). Afterwards, the proposed algorithm selects the most significant EEG features, and using these selected features, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier performs the classification of MI signals. The proposed algorithm has been validated experimentally on two public BCI datasets (BCI Competition II Dataset III and BCI Competition IV Dataset 2b). The classification performance of the algorithm is quantified by the average accuracy and kappa coefficient, whose values are 80.7% and 0.615 respectively. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with standard feature selection methods based on Genetic Algorithm (GA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and ReliefF and performs better than these methods. Further, the proposed algorithm selects the lowest number of features and results in increased computational efficiency, which makes it a promising feature selection tool for an MI-based BCI system.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30802693/,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30802693/,English,Include,,Feature selection using regularized neighbourhood component analysis to enhance the classification performance of motor imagery signals.,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

A measurement (ML-index) using no prior knowledge of the underlying components of the original signals was proposed to quantify the amount of mode mixing and leakage of IMFs. Both synthetic signals and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from motor imagery experiments were used to test the validity. The BCI classification performance using NA-MEMD with the optimal parameters selected based on the ML-index was compared with the performance under the non-optimal parameter condition and the performance using the conventional filtering method. Test on synthetic signals demonstrated the ML-index can effectively quantify the amount of mode mixing and leakage, and help to improve the accuracy of extracting the underlying components. Test on EEG recordings showed the BCI classification performance can be significantly improved under the optimal parameter condition.

Relevant applications of forecasting BCI performance include the ability to adapt the BCI to the needs and expectations of the user, assessing the efficiency of BCI use in stroke rehabilitation, and finally, homogenizing a research population. A limited number of recent studies have proposed the use of subjective questionnaires, such as the Motor Imagery Questionnaire Revised-Second Edition (MIQ-RS). However, further research is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of this type of subjective questionnaire as a BCI performance estimation tool. In this study we aim to answer the following questions: can the MIQ-RS be used to estimate the performance of an MI-based BCI? If not, can we identify different markers that could be used as performance estimators? To answer these questions, we recorded EEG signals from 35 healthy volunteers during BCI use. The subjects had previously completed the MIQ-RS questionnaire. We conducted an offline analysis to assess the correlation between the questionnaire scores related to Kinesthetic and Motor imagery tasks and the performances of four classification methods.

This is probably because it is more difficult to detect the brain activities of lower limb MI. In order to reliably detect the brain activities of lower limbs to restore or improve the walking ability of the disabled, we propose a new paradigm of walking imagery (WI) in a virtual environment (VE), in order to elicit the reliable brain activities and achieve a significant training effect. First, we extract and fuse both the spatial and time-frequency features as a multi-view feature to represent the patterns in the brain activity. Second, we design a multi-view multi-level deep polynomial network (MMDPN) to explore the complementarity among the features so as to improve the detection of walking from an idle state. Our extensive experimental results show that the VE-based paradigm significantly performs better than the traditional text-based paradigm.

However, the classification accuracy of MI signals remains challenging, especially with an increased number of classes and the presence of high variations with data from multiple individual people. This work investigates electroencephalogram (EEG) signal processing techniques, aiming to enhance the classification performance of multiple MI tasks in terms of tackling the challenges caused by the vast variety of subjects. This work introduces a novel method to extract discriminative features by combining the features of functional brain networks with two other feature extraction algorithms: common spatial pattern (CSP) and local characteristic-scale decomposition (LCD). After functional brain networks are established from the MI EEG signals of the subjects, the measures of degree in the binary networks are extracted as additional features and fused with features in the frequency and spatial domains extracted by the CSP and LCD algorithms. A real-time BCI robot control system is designed and implemented with the proposed method. Subjects can control the movement of the robot through four classes of MI tasks. Both the BCI competition IV dataset 2a and real-time data acquired in our designed system are used to validate the performance of the proposed method. As for the offline data experiment results, the average classification accuracy of the proposed method reaches 79.7%, outperforming the majority of popular algorithms. Experimental results with real-time data also prove the proposed method to be highly promising in its real-time performance.

This results in long calibration time that limits the BCI usage in practice. One major challenge in the development of a brain⁻computer interface is to reduce calibration time or completely eliminate it. To address this problem, existing approaches use covariance matrices of electroencephalography (EEG) trials as descriptors for decoding BCI but do not consider the geometry of the covariance matrices, which lies in the space of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. This inevitably limits their performance. We focus on reducing calibration time by introducing SPD based classification approach. However, SPD-based classification has limited applicability in small training sets because the dimensionality of covariance matrices is large in proportion to the number of trials. To overcome this drawback, our paper proposes a new framework that transforms SPD matrices in lower dimension through spatial filter regularized by prior information of EEG channels. The efficacy of the proposed approach was validated on the small sample scenario through Dataset IVa from BCI Competition III. The proposed approach achieved mean accuracy of 86.13 % and mean kappa of 0.72 on Dataset IVa. The proposed method outperformed other approaches in existing studies on Dataset IVa. Finally, to ensure the robustness of the proposed method, we evaluated it on Dataset IIIa from BCI Competition III and Dataset IIa from BCI Competition IV.

The proposed frameworks were evaluated using BCI Competition IV-IIb dataset. In FW1, the raw EEG data is directly presented to the deep neural network without performing any pre-processing. In FW2, the EEG data is first filtered with five band pass filters with fifth order (Butterworth), then the common spatial patterns (CSP) method, which introduces additional pseudo channels, is applied to the filtered signals. Two experiments were conducted for each framework. In the first experiment, a unique DNN is trained for each subject, and in the second experiment only one DNN is trained with the combination of training sets of all subjects. The performance of the two experiments are then compared in terms of average accuracy.  According to the simulation results, we did not observe a significant difference between the average classification accuracies obtained with the first and the second experiments. Therefore, we concluded that, by the use of DNNs we do not need to train several subject-specific networks which requires high computational loads.

Two emerging intuitive mental paradigms, Visual Imagery (VI) and Imagined Speech (IS) show promise to optimise the development of non-invasive BCIs, which involves the extraction of corresponding neural patterns during the imagined tasks. This study took a comprehensive user-centric approach to build on the current foundation of knowledge on VI and IS EEG-BCIs utilising an adapted 1D-CNN to optimise the classification decoding performance. Twenty healthy participants were assessed for their ability to visualise imagery in their minds and performed the VI and IS mental paradigms in two class conditions “push” and “relax”. It was shown that alpha and beta suppression was observed during the “push” condition of VI compared to the “relax” condition, and those that scored higher in the VVIQ had better VI classification accuracy than those who did not. The adapted 1D-CNN model performed well for classification between the two classes “push” and “relax” at 89.3% and 77.87% performance accuracy for VI and IS, respectively. These findings contribute to the current body of work on VI BCI, that it is a dynamic and plausible option compared to standard BCI paradigms, and VI BCI illiteracy could potentially be controlled by VVIQ.

Motor Imagery (MI) brain signals derived from Electroencephalography (EEG) are commonly utilized in various BCI fields. However, accurately classifying MI-based EEG signals remains a significant challenge, with traditional classification techniques struggling to effectively capture both spatial and temporal features, resulting in suboptimal performance. Therefore, this study introduces a novel hybrid Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) framework designed for EEG-MI task classification. The model combines adaptive learning with optimal training to significantly improve classification performance using the Berlin BCI Dataset 1 from BCI Competition IV. The proposed CNN-LSTM model achieves a classification accuracy of 98.38% on subject independence evaluation. This research compares subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), as well as Deep Learning (DL) models, such as EEGNet, K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Raw electroencephalography signals are first preprocessed using appropriate filtering. Feature extraction is carried out afterwards, based on spectral and temporal signal components, and thus a feature vector is constructed. As various features might be inaccurate and mislead the classifier, thus degrading the overall system performance, the proposed approach identifies a subset of features from a large feature space, such that the classifier error rate is reduced. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to reduce the number of features to as low as 0.5% (i.e., the number of ignored features can reach 99.5%) while improving the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the classifier.</jats:p>",,https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci7010012,English,Exclude,Outside date range,A Genetic-Based Feature Selection Approach in the Identification of Left/Right Hand Motor Imagery for a Brain-Computer Interface,,,,,0.95,0.6,

These problems affect the performance of the BCI system and limit the scope of its practical application. In this study, an unsupervised deep-transfer-learning-based method was proposed to deal with the current limitations of BCI systems by applying the idea of transfer learning to the classification of motor imagery EEG signals. The Euclidean space data alignment (EA) approach was adopted to align the covariance matrix of source and target domain EEG data in Euclidean space. Then, the common spatial pattern (CSP) was used to extract features from the aligned data matrix, and the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied for EEG classification.

Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces (MI-BCIs) are AI-driven systems that capture brain activity patterns associated with this mental process and convert them into commands for external devices. Traditionally, MI-BCIs operate on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which require extensive signal processing and feature engineering to extract changes in sensorimotor rhythms (SMR). However, in recent years, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained popularity for EEG classification as they provide a solution for automatic extraction of spatio-temporal features in the signals. In this study, EEG signals from 54 subjects who performed a MI task of left-or right-hand grasp was employed to compare the performance of two MI-BCI classifiers; a ML approach vs. a DL approach. In the ML approach, Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) was used for feature extraction and then Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model was employed for binary classification of the MI task. In the DL approach, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was constructed on the raw EEG signals. The mean classification accuracies achieved by the CNN and CSP+LDA models were 69.42% and 52.56%, respectively. Further analysis showed that the DL approach improved the classification accuracy for all subjects within the range of 2.37 to 28.28% and that the improvement was significantly stronger for low performers. Our findings show promise for employment of DL models in future MI-BCI systems, particularly for BCI inefficient users who are unable to produce desired sensorimotor patterns for conventional ML approaches.</jats:p>",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.448960,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.448960,English,Include,,The Promise of Deep Learning for BCIs: Classification of Motor Imagery EEG using Convolutional Neural Network,Include,,<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Motor Imagery (MI) is a mental process by which an individual rehearses body movements without actually performing physical actions.

The BCI system consists of two main steps which are feature extraction and classification. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) features is extracted from the electroencephalography (EEG) signals to transform the signals into frequency domain. Due to the high dimensionality of data resulting from the feature extraction stage, the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used to minimize the number of dimension by finding the feature subspace that optimizes class separability. Five classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression are used in the study. The performance was tested by using Dataset 1 from BCI Competition IV which consists of imaginary hand and foot movement EEG data. As a result, SVM, Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes classifier achieved the highest accuracy with 89.09% in AUC measurement.</jats:p>",https://doi.org/10.11591/eei.v8i1.1402,https://doi.org/10.11591/eei.v8i1.1402,English,Include,,Motor imagery classification in Brain computer interface (BCI) based on EEG signal by using machine learning technique,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,

The authors investigate two similar CNNs: a single-input CNN with a form of 2-dimensional input from short time Fourier transform (STFT) combining time, frequency and location information, and a multiple-input CNN with 3-dimensional input which processes the electrodes as an independent dimension. Fisher discriminant analysis-type F-score based on band pass (BP) feature and power spectra density (PSD) feature are employed respectively to select the subject-optimal frequency bands. In the experiments, typical frequency bands related to motor imagery EEG signals, subject-optimal frequency bands and extension frequency bands are employed respectively as the frequency range of the input image of CNN. The better classification performance of extension frequency bands show that CNN can extract optimal feature from frequency information automatically. The classification result also demonstrates that the proposed approach is more competitive in prediction of left/right hand motor imagery task compared with other state-of-art approaches.</jats:p>",https://doi.org/10.4018/ijcini.2019070103,https://doi.org/10.4018/ijcini.2019070103,English,Include,,Simple Convolutional Neural Network for Left-Right Hands Motor Imagery EEG Signals Classification,Include,,"<jats:p>This article proposes a classification method of two-class motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on convolutional neural network (CNN), in which EEG signals from C3, C4 and Cz electrodes of publicly available BCI competition IV dataset 2b wer",,0.95,0.6,

Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) can be a tool for the bionic device to communicate with the brain. Signal brain or Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal need to classify to drive the corresponding bionic device. This research goal is to classify the imagination of the right and left-hand movements based on the EEG signal. The system design in this research consists of EEG channel selection using Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter, feature extraction using Common Spatial Pattern (CSP), and classification using Multilayer Perceptron Back Propagation (MLP-BP). The data used a secondary dataset from BCI Competition IV (2b) with 9 research subjects. The research scenario is carried out by trying to use several variations in the number of hidden layer nodes on each EEG channel. Based on the test, the best accuracy for MLP-BP is 68.7% using 24 nodes in the alpha channel.</jats:p>",https://doi.org/10.32736/sisfokom.v11i2.1404,https://doi.org/10.32736/sisfokom.v11i2.1404,English,Include,,EEG Signal Classification of Motor Imagery Right and Left Hand using Common Spatial Pattern and Multilayer Perceptron Back Propagation,Exclude,Insufficient methodological detail,No DL architecture mention in full text or abstract,,0.8,0.6,
